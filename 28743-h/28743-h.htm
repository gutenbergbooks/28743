<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>MISS ASHTON RECEIVES A LETTER.</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Ashton, principal of the Montrose Academy,
established for the higher education of young ladies,
sat with a newly arrived letter in her hand, looking
with a troubled face over its contents.</p>
<p>Letters of this kind were of constant occurrence,
but this had in it a different tone from any she had
previously received.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tender and true,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;How
sorry I am, I can do nothing for her!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the letter:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Miss Ashton</span>,&mdash;I have a daughter Marion, now sixteen
years old. Developing at this age what we think rather an unusual
amount of talent, we are desirous to send her to a good school at the
East.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>We have been at the West twenty years as Home Missionaries.
When I tell you that, I need not add that we have been made very
happy by being able to save money enough to give Marion at least a
year under your kind care, if you can receive her into your school.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I think I can safely promise you that she will be faithful and industrious;
and I earnestly hope that the lovely Christian character
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
she has sustained at home, may deepen and brighten in the new life
which will open to her in the East.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>May I ask your patience while she is accustoming herself to it; of
your kindness I am well assured.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 6.25em;'>Truly yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 2.0em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>E. G. Parke.</span></span><br /></p>
<p>&#8220;The child of a poor, far western missionary, so
different from the class of girls that she will be with
here,&#8221; thought Miss Ashton as she slowly folded the
letter.</p>
<p>She sat for some time thinking over its contents,
then she took her pen, and wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Mrs. Parke</span>,&mdash;Send your daughter to me. I have great
interest in, and sympathy with, all Home Missionary work. I wish I
could do something to lighten the expenses she must incur; but this
is a chartered institution, and at present all the places to be filled by
those who need assistance have been taken. I will, however, bear
her in mind; and should she prove a good scholar, exemplary in her
behavior, I may be able to render her in the future some acceptable
assistance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>Wishing you all success in your trying and arduous life, and the
help of the great Helper,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 6.25em;'>I am, truly yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 2.0em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>C. S. Ashton</span>.</span><br /></p>
<p>Miss Ashton did not seal this note; she tossed it
upon her desk, meaning to look it over before it was
mailed; but she had no time, and, with many misgivings
as to what might come of it, she allowed it to
go as it was.</p>
<p>Her school had never been fuller than it promised
to be on the opening of this new year. Through
the summer vacation letters had been coming to her
from all parts of the country asking to put girls who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
had finished graded and high school education under
her care. Established for many years, the academy
had grown from what, in the religious world, was
considered a &#8220;missionary training-school,&#8221; and from
which many able and faithful women had gone forth
to win laurels in the over-ripe harvest fields, to a
school better adapted to the wants of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>While it held its religious prestige, it also offered
unusual advantages to that important and numerous
class of girls who, not wishing a college education,
were yet desirous to spend the years that should
change them from girls into women in preparation
for a future great in its aims, and also great in its
results.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton, large-hearted and strong-headed, seeing
wisely into this future, had succeeded in offering
to this class exactly what it had demanded.</p>
<p>Ably seconded by an efficient and generous board
of trustees, with ample funds, excellent teachers to
assist her, a convenient and handsome building in
which to hold the school, she had readily made it a
success. There were more applications for admittance
than she could find room for; indeed, every available
corner of the house had been promised when she
received Mrs. Parke&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happened that a scholar for some
unforeseen reason failed to appear; that might make
an opening for Marion. She wanted this Western
girl; the missionary spirit of olden times came back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
to her with a warmth and freshness it would have
cheered the hearts of the long-absent ones in heathen
lands to know. The crowd of scholars began to
gather. They came from the north and the south,
the east and the west, with a remarkable promptness.
On the day for the opening of the term every room
was full, and many who had delayed applying for
places&mdash;taking it for granted there was always a
vacancy&mdash;were sent disappointed away.</p>
<p>There seemed to be positively no spot for Marion;
and, in spite of all the cares and perplexities which
each day brought her, Miss Ashton could not forget
it. It became a positive source of worry to her before
she received a letter stating the day on which
Marion would arrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not a good beginning, to be a week after
the opening of the term,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I hope
she will bring a good excuse.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>MARION ENTERS SCHOOL.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a beautiful September twilight when a
young girl came timidly into the main entrance of
the Young Ladies&#8217; Academy at Montrose.</p>
<p>Six days and four nights ago she had left her
home in Oregon, delayed by the sickness of one of
the companions under whose escort she was to come
to Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Before this journey she had never been more than
ten miles from home, and it was a wonderful new
world into which the cars so quickly brought her.</p>
<p>Mountains, plains, rivers, cities, villages, seemed to
fly by her as the train dashed along. She had no
time to miss the familiar scenes of her own home.</p>
<p>The flat prairie, over whose long reaches gay
flowers blossomed, the little villages dotted here and
there, with now and then a small, white steeple
pointing heavenward,&mdash;her father&#8217;s church among
them, with the neat parsonage, so much of which he
had built with his own hand, and the dear ones she
had left behind her there.</p>
<p>To-day she had reached her destination, and a
smiling girl had met her at the door and ushered
her into the lower corridor of the academy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>It was just after tea, an hour given up to social
enjoyment, and the corridor was full of young girls,
busy and noisy.</p>
<p>The stranger shrank back into the recess of the
door; she hoped no one would see her: if she could
only escape until the principal came, how glad she
should be!</p>
<p>Little groups kept constantly passing her; many
from among them turned their heads and looked at
her inquiringly; some smiled and bowed, but no one
spoke, until a tall girl who had passed and repassed
her a number of times left her party and came to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are our two hundredth!&#8221; she said, holding
her hand out cordially toward her. &#8220;We are glad you
have come! Now we are the largest number that
have ever been in this school at one time. Shall I
take you to Miss Ashton?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion held very tight to the hand that was given
her as they passed together down through the lines
of scholars toward the principal&#8217;s room. More smiles
and cheery nods met her, and now and then she
caught &#8220;two hundredth&#8221; as she passed.</p>
<p>A knock at a door was immediately answered by
a pleasant &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Dorothy, is it? I&#8217;m always glad to
see you,&#8221; said Miss Ashton, rising from the table at
which she had been writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you your new pupil,&#8221; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m very glad to see her. It is Marion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Parke, I presume. You have had a long, hard
journey, but you look so well I need not ask how
you have borne it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she was giving Marion this welcome, Miss
Ashton, with the quick look by which her long experience
had accustomed her to judging something of
character, saw in the timid new pupil a very different
girl from what in her troubled thoughts of her she
had expected her to be.</p>
<p>Two large gray eyes from under long, drooping
eyelids met hers with an appealing look; lips trembled
sensitively as they tried to answer her, and a delicate
color came slowly up over the rounded cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to be late,&#8221; Marion said with a
self-possession that belied the timidity her face expressed;
&#8220;but sickness of my friends with whom I
was to come, detained me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no doubt there was a sufficient reason,&#8221;
Miss Ashton answered kindly. &#8220;You are a week
behind most of the others, but you can make the
time up with diligence. Dorothy, please take Marion
to the guest-room for to-night. I will see you later.
I am very glad you are here safely. You will have
time after tea to write a few lines home. Give my
love to your mother, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy led the way to the guest-room. It was a
pretty room near Miss Ashton&#8217;s, kept for the convenience
of entertaining guests. Dorothy threw
open the window-blinds, and Marion saw before her
a New England village.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>In the near distance rose hill upon hill, their sides
covered with elegant residences, and what she thought
were palaces, crowning their tops. The light of
this September twilight covered them with a mantle
of gold, lit up the broad river that ran at the base of
the hills like a translucent band, turned the tall
chimneys of factories in the adjacent city, usually so
disfiguring, into minarets, blazing with rich Oriental
coloring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not beautiful?&#8221; Dorothy asked, slipping
her arm around Marion&#8217;s waist, and drawing her
nearer the window; &#8220;we have it always&mdash;<i>always</i> to
look at, morning, noon, and night, and it is never the
same twice. I was born and brought up by the sea,
and I&#8217;ve been here three years, yet I love it better
and better every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born and brought up on the prairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The land seas,&#8221; added Dorothy. &#8220;How strange
they must be! I would like to see the prairies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grand thing about this is, it belongs to you all
the time you stay here, just as much as if you really
owned it; nobody can take it from you; there it is,
and there it must remain. That is the reason they
built our academy on this high hill, so it should be
ours, a part of our education,&mdash;&#8216;Grow into us,&#8217; Miss
Ashton says, and it does.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they stood looking at it the twilight deepened;
the golden flush faded away. Over hill and
river crept the shadows of the night, and out from
the adjoining corridor sounded a loud gong, the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
one Marion had ever heard. She turned a frightened
face toward Dorothy, who said, &#8220;Our gong; study
hours begin now, so I must go: I shall see you
to-morrow.&#8221; Then she hurried away, and Marion
was left alone; but she had hardly gone, before there
was a gentle tap upon her door, then it opened, and
Miss Benton, one of the teachers, came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, all alone in the dark! That&#8217;s lonely for
a new pupil. Let me light your gas, and then I will
take you down to tea; you must be very hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was kind, and her manner gentle. She
lighted the gas, then slipped Marion&#8217;s arm into hers,
and took her through the long, bright corridors to
the dining-hall. Here, a pleasant-faced matron came
to meet her. She gave her a seat at a table, which
she told her would be hers permanently, then seated
herself by Marion&#8217;s side and talked to her cheerfully
as she ate. It was all so homelike; every one she
had met was kind and friendly. It would be her
own fault certainly if she were not contented and
happy here, Marion thought.</p>
<p>Tea over, she tried to find her way alone back to
her room, but there were corridors leading to stairs,
corridors leading to recitation rooms, corridors leading
to a large hall dimly lighted, corridors leading
everywhere but where she wanted to go, and, for a
wonder, no one to be seen of whom she could ask
direction. There was something so ludicrous in the
situation, that every now and then Marion burst into
a merry little laugh; and after a time one of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
laughs was echoed, and, turning, she saw a short, fat
little woman with very light hair, and light blue eyes,
who came directly to her, holding up two small hands
and laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, new der Mundel,&#8221; she said; &#8220;Two Hundert
they call you. What for you hier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my way. I can&#8217;t find my room,&#8221; said
Marion, still laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What der Raum?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion was startled. Was this an insane woman
who was walking at large in the corridors? What
sort of a jargon was this she was talking to her?</p>
<p>Had it been wholly German, or even correct
German, Marion would have understood her, at
least in part; but this language, what was it? The
speaker, much to the amusement of the whole school,
used a curious medley of neither English nor German
in her attempt to speak the English, seeming to
forget the proper use of her own language.</p>
<p>Marion answered her now with a half-frightened,
&#8220;Ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You not stand under me? I am your teacher,
German. I am Fr&auml;ulein Sausmann. Berlin I vas
born. I teach you der German. Come, tell me, Two
Hundert, vere vas your der Raum, vat you call it?
Your apart<i>a</i>ment, vere you seep?&#8221; shutting up her
small eyes tight, and leaning her head on one hand,
to represent a pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guest-room,&#8221; said Marion, now understanding
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Der guest-room? Oui, oui, Madamoselle. I
chap<i>p</i>eron you,&mdash;come!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seizing one of Marion&#8217;s hands, she led her to her
room, opening the door, then, standing on the tips
of her small feet and kissing her on both cheeks, she
said in English, &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; kissed her own hand,
and, throwing the kiss toward Marion, disappeared.</p>
<p>Marion found her trunk in her room unstrapped,
and, tired as she was, began to make preparations for
spending the night there.</p>
<p>She did not suppose for a moment it was to be
permanently hers, but fell asleep wondering what
could be next in waiting for her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>GLADYS HAS A ROOM-MATE.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Dorothy left Marion at the call of the gong
for study hours she went at once to her own room.</p>
<p>She had two room-mates, both her cousins; one,
Gladys Philbrick, was a Florida girl, the only child
of a wealthy owner of several orange-groves. She
was motherless, and needed a woman&#8217;s care, and the
advantages of a Northern education, so her father
sent her to live with relatives in the small seaport
town of Rock Cove.</p>
<p>The other, Susan Downer, was the child of a sister
of Mr. Philbrick; her father followed the sea, and
her brother, almost the one boy in Rock Cove who
did not look upon a sailor life as the only one worth
living, was at the present time a student at the
academy at Atherton, only a few miles from Montrose.
Dorothy herself was the child of a fisherman&mdash;her
own mother dead, and she left under the care
of a weak stepmother, whose numerous family of
small children had made Dorothy&#8217;s life one of constant
hardship.</p>
<p>When Mr. Philbrick, in one of his visits to Gladys
at the North, became acquainted with this little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
group of cousins, he had no hesitation&mdash;being not
only an educated man, but also one of a great heart
and generous nature&mdash;in making plans for their
future education. In carrying these out, he had
sent Jerry Downer to Atherton; Gladys, Susan, and
Dorothy to Montrose.</p>
<p>Her cousins were already busy with their books
when Dorothy came into the room; and, careful not
to disturb them, she sat quietly down to study her
own lessons, but she could not fix her mind upon
them. Marion alone down-stairs, homesick, with
no one to say a kind word to her, or to tell her about
the school, &#8220;a stranger in a strange land,&#8221; she kept
repeating to herself; &#8220;and such a sweet-looking
girl. It&#8217;s too bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>Try her best not to, she still found herself watching
the hands of the clock. For a wonder she was
anxious to have study hours over; she wanted to
tell her cousins about Marion.</p>
<p>As it proved, they were quite as anxious to hear;
for no sooner had the clock struck nine, and the
gong struck again for the close, as it had for the
opening of study hours, than they shut their books,
and Gladys said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about Two Hundred? What a way you
have, Dorothy, of always finding out people who
want you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was all alone,&#8221; said Dorothy, by way of
answer; &#8220;and she looked so lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about her,&#8221; said Susan. &#8220;Never mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the lonely; new scholars always are; that&#8217;s a part of
their education, Miss Ashton says. We should have
been if we hadn&#8217;t been all together. What is she
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s lovely,&#8221; said Dorothy. &#8220;She is pretty,
and she isn&#8217;t. Her hair just waves all over her
head; and her eyes were blue, and they were hazel,
and they were&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gray!&#8221; put in Gladys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose they were gray; but they were
all colors, but cat colors, until it grew too dark for
me to see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall like her. I wish she could have a room
near us. Her eyes tell true tales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can,&#8221; said Gladys instantly. &#8220;She can
room with me. I am the only girl in school who
hasn&#8217;t a room-mate. You wait&#8221;&mdash;and Gladys, without
another word, hurried out of the room. She
very well knew that after nine Miss Ashton disliked
a call unless there was some imperative necessity for
it, so she knocked so gently on the closed door that
she was hardly heard; and when at last Miss Ashton
appeared, she looked so tired, and her smile was so
wan, that Gladys, eager as she was, wished she had
been more thoughtful; but, in her impulsive way,
she blundered out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can come to me. I&#8217;m all alone, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can come to you, Gladys?&#8221; If it had been
any other of her pupils, Miss Ashton would have
been surprised; but three years had taught her that
this Florida girl was exceptional.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two Hundred! Dorothy says she is lovely,
with big eyes, and lonely&#8221;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Marion Parke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s her name. We all call her Two
Hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must not call her so any more. It
would annoy her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never will if you&#8217;ll please let her come and
room with me. It&#8217;s such a cheerful room, and I&#8217;ll be
ever so nice to her, Miss Ashton; try me, and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Gladys, you know your father pays me an
extra price for your having your room to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Miss Ashton,&#8221;&mdash;looking earnestly in
Miss Ashton&#8217;s face,&mdash;&#8220;he would be ashamed of me
if I wasn&#8217;t willing to share it with her. Please!
I&#8217;ll be as amiable as an angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ashton knew the cousins well. She knew,
if she excepted Susan, of whom she felt always in
doubt, she could hardly have chosen out of her school
any girls from whom she would have expected kinder
and safer treatment for the new-comer. &#8220;How could
I have doubted God would provide for this missionary
child!&#8221; she thought, as she looked down into the
earnest face beside her; but she only said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Gladys; I will think it over!&#8221; and
Gladys, not at all sure her offer would be accepted,
went back to her room.</p>
<p>The next morning, it must be confessed, things
looked differently to her from what they had on the
previous night. It was such a luxury to have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
whole room to herself; to throw her things about
&#8220;only a little,&#8221; but that little enough to make it
look untidy. She did not exactly wish she had
waited until she knew more of Marion, and she tried
to excuse her reluctance to herself by the doubt
whether she ought not to have consulted her cousins,
as their parlor was a room common to them all; but
it was too late now, and when she received a little
note from Miss Ashton, saying she should send
Marion to her directly after breakfast, she made
hasty preparations for her reception.</p>
<p>The dining-hall was filled with small tables, around
which the girls had taken their seats, when Miss
Benton came in with Marion. Generally a new-comer
was hardly noticed among so many; but the
peculiarity of Marion&#8217;s admittance, rounding their
number to the largest the school had ever held, made
her a marked character for the time. Every eye
was turned upon her as she, wholly unconscious of
the attention she attracted, walked quietly behind
the teacher to a seat next to Gladys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladys, this is your new room-mate,&#8221; said Miss
Benton. Then she introduced her to the others at
the table, and left her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grace before meat,&#8221; whispered Gladys to her as
the customary signal for asking a blessing was given.
Miss Ashton rose, and every head in the crowded
hall was reverently bowed as she prayed.</p>
<p>They were the first words of prayer Marion had
heard since she knelt by her father&#8217;s side in the far-away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
home on the morning of her departure. &#8220;The
same God here as there!&#8221; Among this crowd of
strangers this thought came to her with the comfort
its realization everywhere, and at all times, brings.
Even here, she was not alone.</p>
<p>There was a low-toned, pleasant hum of conversation
at the table during breakfast; the teacher who
presided drew Marion skilfully into it now and
then; and she was the centre of a little group as the
school went from the hall to the chapel, where a
short religious service was every morning conducted.</p>
<p>This was under Miss Ashton&#8217;s special care, and
she took great pains to make it the keynote of the
school-life for the day. So far in the term, what
she said had its bearing on the immediate duties
before them; but this morning she had felt the
need of meeting the cases of homesickness with
which the opening of every new year abounded, and
which seemed, to the pupils at least, matters of the
greatest and saddest importance.</p>
<p>She chose one of the most cheerful hymns in the
collection they used, by which to bring the tone of
the school into harmony with her remarks; and,
after it was sung, she said:&mdash;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IV_SETTLING_DOWN_TO_WORK' id='CHAPTER_IV_SETTLING_DOWN_TO_WORK'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>SETTLING DOWN TO WORK.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;If I were to ask, which I am too wise to do,&#8221;&mdash;here
a smile broke out over the faces of her audience&mdash;&#8220;those
among you who are homesick to rise,
how many do you suppose I should see upon their
feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>A laugh now, and a good deal of elbow-nudging
among the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the twenty years I have been principal of
this academy, I have seen a great deal of this sickness,
and I have sympathy with, and pity for it. It
has been often told us that the Swiss, away from
their Alpine homes, often die of it, but I have never
yet found a case that was in the least danger of becoming
fatal; so far from it, I might say, that when,
since the Comforter sent to us in all our troubles
has taken the sickness under his healing care, my
most homesick pupils have become my happiest and
most contented; so, if I do not seem to suffer with
you, my suffering pupils, it is because I have no fear
of the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a prescription to offer you this morning.
Love your home&mdash;the more the better; but keep a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
great place in your hearts for your studies. Give
us good recitations in the place of tears. <i>Study</i>&mdash;study
cheerfully, earnestly, faithfully, and if this fails
to cure you, come and tell me. I shall see I have
made a wrong diagnosis of your condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another laugh over the room, in which some of
the unhappy ones were seen to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few words more. I take it for granted that
when a young girl comes to join my school, she
comes as a lady. There are qualifications needed to
establish one&#8217;s claim to the title. I shall state them
briefly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindness to, and thoughtfulness of, others;
politeness, even in trifles; courtesy that wins hearts,
generosity that makes friends, unselfishness that loves
another better than one&#8217;s self, integrity that commands
confidence, neatness which attracts; tastefulness,
a true woman&#8217;s strength; good manners, without
which all my list of virtues is in vain; cleanliness
next to godliness; and, above all, true godliness that
makes the noblest type of woman,&mdash;a Christian lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she offered a short, fervent prayer, and the
school filed out quietly to the different class-rooms
for their morning recitations.</p>
<p>She spoke to Marion as she passed her, and
Marion knew that the dreaded hour of her examination
had come. She followed Miss Ashton to a room
set apart for such purposes; and, to her surprise, the
first words the principal said to her were,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and sit down by me, Marion, and tell me
all about your home!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About home!&#8221; Marion&#8217;s heart was very tender
this morning, and when she raised her eyes to Miss
Ashton, they were full of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to learn more of your mother,&#8221;&mdash;no
notice was taken of the tears. &#8220;I had such a nice
letter from her about your coming, so nice that,
though I hadn&#8217;t even a corner to put you in, I
could not resist receiving you; and now you are invited
to come into the very rooms where I should
have been most satisfied to put you. I will tell you
about your future room-mates; I think you will be
happy there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she told her of the three cousins, dwelling
upon their characters generally, leaving Marion to
form her particular opinion as she became acquainted
with them.</p>
<p>What the examination was Marion never could
recall. Her father was a college graduate. Her
mother had been educated at one of our best New
England schools, and her own education had been
given her with much care by them both.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton found her, with the exception of
mathematics, easily prepared to enter her middle
class; and the mathematics she had no doubt she
could make up.</p>
<p>Probably there was not a happier girl among the
whole two hundred than Marion when, with a few
kind, personal words, Miss Ashton dismissed her.
Her past studies approved, and her future so delightfully
planned for.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>Miss Ashton gave her the number of her room in
the third corridor, telling her that the same young
lady she had seen on the previous night was waiting
to receive her.</p>
<p>When, after some difficulty, she found her way
there, the door was opened by Dorothy, who had
been watching for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our all-together parlor,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Gladys, you know, and Susan,&mdash;this is my cousin,
Susan Downer. We are glad to have you with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple welcome, but it was hearty, and
we all know how much that means.</p>
<p>Gladys led her to the window. &#8220;Come here first,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and look out.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the same view she had seen from the guest-room
the night before, only now it was soft and
tender in the light of a half-clouded autumn sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father said, when he saw it, it ought to make
us better, nobler, and happier to have this to look
at. That was asking a great deal, was not it? because,
you see, we get used to it. But there&#8217;s the sea; you
know how the sea looks, never the same twice;
because it&#8217;s still and full of ripples to-day, you don&#8217;t
know but the waves will be tumbling over Judith&#8217;s
Woe to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw the ocean,&#8221; said Marion. &#8220;That is
one of the great things I have come to the East to
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never saw the ocean?&#8221; repeated Gladys, looking
at Marion as curiously as if she had told her she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
never saw the sun. &#8220;Oh, what a treat you have
before you! I almost envy you. This is well
enough for a landscape, but the seascapes leave you
nothing to desire. Now, come to our room. You
are to chum with me, and we will be awful good and
kind to each other, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How happy I shall be here!&#8221; was Marion&#8217;s
answer, as she looked around the rooms. &#8220;I wish
my mother could see it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she could,&#8221; said Dorothy kindly.</p>
<p>The rooms in this academy building were planned
in suites,&mdash;a parlor, with two bedrooms opening from
it. These accommodated four pupils, unless, as was
frequently the case, some parents wished their
daughter&mdash;as did Gladys&#8217;s father&mdash;to have her
sleeping-room to herself. In this case extra payment
was made.</p>
<p>Marion found her trunk already in Gladys&#8217;s room,
and the work of settling down was quickly and
pleasantly done, with the help of her three schoolmates.
Lucky Marion! She had certainly, so far,
begun her Eastern life under the pleasantest auspices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>MRS. PARKE&#8217;S LETTER.</h3>
</div>
<p>And now commenced Marion&#8217;s work. She was
not quite fitted in higher mathematics, and Miss
Palmer, not disposed to be too indulgent in a study
where stupid girls tried her patience to its utmost
every day of her life, conditioned her without hesitation.</p>
<p>Miss Jones found her fully up, even before her
class, in Latin and Greek; her father having taken
special pains in this part of her education, being himself
one of the elect in classical studies when in Yale
College. Her words of commendation almost made
amends to Marion for Miss Palmer&#8217;s brief dismissal;
almost, not quite, for, in common with nine-tenths of
the scholars in the academy, Marion &#8220;hated mathematics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Sausmann tried her on the pronunciation of
a few German gutturals, then patted her on the
shoulder and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marrione, you vill do vell; you may koom: I vill
be most gladness to &#8217;ave you koom. I vill give unto
you one, two, three private lessons. You may koom
to-day, at four. The stupid class vill not smile at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
you; you vill make no mistakens.&#8221; Then she kissed
Marion as affectionately as if she had been a dear
old friend, and watched her as she went down the
long corridor. Some words she said to herself in
German, smiled pleasantly, waved two little hands
after the retreating figure, and smiled again, this
time with some self-congratulatory shakes of the
head.</p>
<p>The truth was, though German was an elective
study, it was by no means a favorite in the school,
and, it may be, Miss Sausmann was not a popular
teacher. Broken English, too great an affection for,
and estimation of the grandeur of, the Fatherland,
joined with a quick temper, do not always make a
successful teacher.</p>
<p>The girls, moreover, had fallen rather into the habit
of making fun of her, and this did not add to her
happiness. In Marion she thought she saw a friend,
and very welcome she was.</p>
<p>The arrangement that put four scholars in one
room for study, also was not the wisest on the part
of the architect of Montrose Academy. If he had
taught school for even one year, he would have found
how easy it was for a restless scholar to destroy the
quiet so essential to all true work.</p>
<p>In Marion&#8217;s room there was not a stupid or a lazy
girl; but they committed their lessons at such different
times, and in such different ways, that they
often proved the greatest annoyance to each other.</p>
<p>One of the first obstacles Marion found as she bent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
herself to real hard work, was the need of a place
where her attention was not continually called from
her book to something one of her room-mates was
doing or saying.</p>
<p>To be sure, it was one of the rules of the school
that there should be perfect quiet in the room during
study hours, but that was absolutely impossible; and
Marion, especially with her mathematics, found herself
struggling to keep her thoughts upon her lesson,
until she grew so nervous that she could not tell <i>x</i>
from <i>y</i>, or demonstrate the most common proposition
in an intelligible way; and now she found to her surprise
a new life-lesson waiting for her to learn, one
not in books. So far, her life had all been made
easy and sure by the wise parents who had never
allowed anything to interfere with their child&#8217;s best
interests; as they had made more and greater sacrifices
than she ever knew, to send her East for her
education, so nothing that could prepare her for it
had been forgotten or neglected.</p>
<p>The very opportunities she had craved had been
granted her, and she found herself hindered by such
trifles as Gladys moving restlessly around the room,
her own lessons well learned, lifting up a window
curtain and letting a glare of sunshine fall over her
book, knocking the corner of the study table, pushing
a chair; no matter how trifling the disturbance,
it meant a distracted attention, and lost time; or,
Susan would fidget in her chair, draw long and loud
breaths, push away one book noisily and take up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
another, fix her eyes steadily on Marion, look as if
she were watching the slow progress she made, and
wondering at it.</p>
<p>Even Dorothy, dear, good Dorothy, was not without
her share in the annoyance. If she had any
occasion to move about the room, &#8220;she creeps as if
she knew how it troubles me, and was ashamed of
me,&#8221; thought nervous Marion.</p>
<p>In her weekly letters home she gave to her mother
an exact account of her daily life, and among the hindrances
she found this nervous susceptibility was
not omitted. It had never occurred to her that it
was a thing under her own control, therefore she
was not a little surprised when she received the following
letter from her mother:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My Dear Child</span>,&mdash;You are not starting right. What your room-mates
do, or do not do, is none of your concern. Learn at once what I
hoped you had learned, at least in part, before leaving home, to fix
your mind upon your lesson, to the shutting out of all else while that
is being learned. I know how difficult this will seem to you, with
your attention distracted by everything so new about you; <i>but it can
be done</i>, and it must be if you are to acquire in the only way that will
be of any true use to you in the future. Remember that the very first
thing you are to do, in truth the end and aim of all education, is to
develop and strengthen the powers of your mind. Acquisition is,
I had almost written, only useful in so far as it tends to this great
result. When you leave school, if your memory is stored with all the
facts which the curriculum of your school affords, and you lack in the
mental control which makes them at your service, your education has
only made your mind a lumber-room, full perhaps to overflowing, but
useless for the great needs of life. Now you will wonder what all this
has to do with your being made uncomfortable, so that you could not
study, by the restlessness of your room-mates. If you begin at once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
to fix your mind, as I hope you will soon be able to do, on your lesson,
you will be delighted to find how little you will be disturbed by anything
going on around you, and how soon your ability to concentrate
your working powers will increase.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Try it faithfully, my dear one, and write me the result. I
want to send you one other help, which I am sure you will enjoy.
In your studies, make for yourself as much variety as possible.
By <i>that</i>, I mean when you are tired of your Latin do not take up
your Greek; take your mathematics, or your logic, or your literature,&mdash;any
study that will give you an entire change. Change is
rest; and this is truer even in mental work than in physical. Above
all, <i>do not worry</i>. Nothing deteriorates the mind like this useless
worry. When you have done your best over a lesson, do not weary
and weaken yourself by fears of failure in your recitation room.
Nothing will insure this failure so certainly as to expect it. Cultivate
the feeling that your teacher is your friend, and more ready to
help you, if you falter, than to blame you. You think Miss Palmer
is hard on you in your mathematics, and don&#8217;t like you. Avoid personalities.
At present, you probably annoy Miss Palmer by your
blunders; but that is class work, and I do not doubt a little sharpness
on her part is good for you; but, out of the recitation room, you
are only &#8216;one of the girls,&#8217; and if you come in contact with her, I
have no doubt you will find her an agreeable lady. There is a tinge
of self-consciousness about this, which I am most anxious for you to
avoid. I want you to forget there is such a person in the world as
Marion Parke, in your school intercourse; but more of this at
another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here follows a few pages written of the home-life,
which Marion reads with great tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>What her mother has written her Marion had
heard many times before leaving home, but its
practical application now made it seem a different
thing. She could not help the thought that if her
mother had been in her place, had been surrounded
as she was by the new life,&mdash;the teachers, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
scholars, the routine of everyday,&mdash;if she had seen
the anxious, pale faces of many of the girls when
they came into the recitation room, and the tears
that were often furtively wiped away after a failure,
she would not have thought it so easy to fix your
attention on your lesson, undisturbed by any external
thing, or to bend your efforts to the development
of your mind, above every other purpose: but,
after all, the letter was not without its salutary
effect; and coming as it did at the beginning of
Marion&#8217;s school career, will prove of great benefit
to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>SCHOOL CLIQUES.</h3>
</div>
<p>The trustees of Montrose Academy had not only
chosen a fine site upon which to erect the building,
but they had also very wisely bought twenty acres
of adjacent land, and laid it out in pretty landscape
gardening. There was a grove of fine old trees,
that they trimmed and made winding paths where
the shade was the deepest and the boughs interlaced
their arms most gracefully. They cut a narrow
driveway, which proved so inviting that, after a short
time, there had to appear the inevitable placard,
&#8220;Trespassing forbidden.&#8221; A small brook made its
way surging down to the broad river that flowed
through the town; this they caused to be dammed,
and in a short time they had a pond, over which
they built fanciful bridges. The pond was large
enough for boats; and these, decked with the school
color,&mdash;a dainty blue,&mdash;were always filled with
pretty girls, who handled the light oars, if not with
skill, at least with grace, and, as Miss Ashton knew,
with perfect safety.</p>
<p>During the fine days of the matchless September
weather, this grove was the favorite resort of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
girls through the hours allotted to exercise; and
here Marion, having found a quiet, shaded nook
where she could be sure of being alone, brought her
book and did some of her best studying.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough,&#8221; she thought with much self-gratulation,
&#8220;to fix your mind on what you are doing,
with nothing to disturb you; but it&#8217;s a different thing
when there are three other minds that won&#8217;t fix at
the same time. I just wish mother would try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day, however, when her satisfaction was the
most complete over an easily mastered Latin lesson,
a laughing face peeped down upon her through her
canopy of green leaves, and a voice said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught you, Marion Parke! Now I&#8217;m going
straight in to report you to Miss Ashton, and you&#8217;ll
see what you&#8217;ll get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I?&#8221; asked Marion, laughing back.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll ask you very politely to take a seat by her
on the sofa, and then she&#8217;ll look straight in your eyes
and she&#8217;ll say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am very sorry, Marion, to find you so soon after
joining my school breaking one of my most important
regulations.&#8217; (She always says regulations; we
don&#8217;t have any rules here.) &#8216;I had expected better
things of you, as you are a minister&#8217;s daughter, and
came from the far West.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is studying your lesson, then, breaking a rule?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Studying it in exercise hours is an unpardonable
sin. Don&#8217;t you know we are sent out into the open
air for rest, change, exercise? You ought to be rowing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
walking, playing croquet, tennis, base-ball, football.
You&#8217;ve to recruit your shattered energies,
instead of winding them up to the highest pitch.
We&#8217;ve been watching you, but no one liked to tell
you, so I came. I won&#8217;t tell Miss Ashton this time,
if you&#8217;ll promise me solemnly you&#8217;ll join our croquet
party, and always play on our side! Come; we&#8217;re
waiting for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until I come back,&#8221; said Marion, rising hastily,
and gathering up her books. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
there was any such a rule&mdash;regulation, I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, half frightened and half amused, she went
back to the house, straight to Miss Ashton&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton was busy, but she met her with a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ashton,&#8221; said Marion, &#8220;I am very sorry; I
didn&#8217;t know it was against your wishes. I found
such a lovely, quiet little nook in the grove, and
I&#8217;ve been studying there when Mamie Smythe says I
ought to have been exercising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have done wrong,&#8221; said Miss Ashton
gravely. &#8220;I understand that the newness of your
work makes your lessons difficult, but there is nothing
to be gained by overwork. Come to me at some
other time, and I will talk with you more about it.
Now go, for the pleasantest thing you can find to do
in the way of healthful exercise. There are some
fine roses in blossom on the lawn; I wish you would
pick me a nice, large bunch for my vase. Look at
the poor thing! See how drooping the flowers are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>Mamie Smythe&#8217;s croquet party waited in vain for
Marion&#8217;s return; but on the beautiful lawn, where
the late roses were doing their best to prolong their
summer beauty, Marion went from bush to bush,
picking the fairest, and conning a lesson which somehow
seemed to her to be a postscript to her mother&#8217;s
letter, that was, &#8220;Study wisely done was the only true
study.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawn itself, cultured and tasteful, had its share,
and by no means a small one, in the work of education.
Clusters of ornamental trees, dotted here and
there over its soft green, were interspersed with
lovely flower-beds, in which were growing not only
rare flowers, but the dear old blossoms,&mdash;candytuft,
narcissus, clove-pinks, jonquils, heart&#8217;s-ease, daffodils,
and many another to which the eyes of some
of the young girls turned lovingly, for they knew
they were blossoming in their dear home garden.</p>
<p>As Marion was going to her room, after taking her
roses to Miss Ashton, she found Mamie Smythe waiting
for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;O you poor Marion!&#8221; she said, catching Marion
by the arm, &#8220;I&mdash;I hope she didn&#8217;t scold you; she
never does&mdash;never; but she looks so hurt. I never
would have told on you, and nobody would. We all
knew you didn&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told on myself,&#8221; said Marion, laughing, &#8220;and
she punished me. Don&#8217;t you see how broken-hearted
I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>did</i> she do to you? Why, Marion Parke,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
she is always good to those who confess and don&#8217;t
wait to be found out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She sent me out to pick her a lovely bunch of
roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Mamie. Then a small crowd of girls
gathered round them, Mamie telling them the story
in her own peculiar way, much to their amusement;
for Mamie was the baby and the wit of the school, a
spoiled child at home, a generous, merry favorite at
school, a good scholar when she chose to be, but
fonder of fun and mischief than of her books, consequently
a trouble to her teachers. She was a classmate
of Marion, and for some unaccountable reason,
as no two could have been more unlike, had taken a
great fancy to her, one of those fancies which are
apt to abound in any gathering of young girls. Had
Marion returned it with equal ardor, the two, even
short as the term had been, would be now inseparable;
but Marion had her room-mates for company when
her lessons left her any time, and Gladys and Dorothy
had already learned to love her. As for Susan,
she seemed of little account in their room. She
would have said of herself that she &#8220;moved in a very
different circle,&#8221; and that was true; even a boarding-school
has its cliques, and to one of the largest of
these Susan prided herself upon belonging. Just
what it consisted of it would be difficult to say, certainly
not of the best scholars, for then both Gladys
and Dorothy would have been there; not of the
wealthiest girls, for then, again, Gladys Philbrick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
was one of the richest girls in the school; not of the
most mischievous, or of idlers, for then Miss Ashton
would have found some way of separating them; yet
there it was, certain girls clubbing together at all
hours and in all places, where any intercourse was
allowed, to the exclusion of others: walking together,
having spreads in each other&#8217;s rooms, going to concerts,
to meetings, anywhere and everywhere, always
together.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton, in her twenty years of experience
had seen a great deal of this; but she had learned
that the best way of dealing with it was to be ignorant
of it, unless it interfered in some way with the
regular duties of the school. This it had only done
occasionally, and then had met with prompt discipline.
As several of the leaders had graduated the
last Commencement, she had hoped, as she had done
many times before, only to be disappointed, that the
new year would see less of it; but it had seemed to
her already to have assumed more importance than
ever, so early in the fall term.</p>
<p>She very soon saw Mamie Smythe&#8217;s devotion to
Marion, and knowing how fascinating the girl could
make herself when she wished, and how genial was
Marion&#8217;s great Western heart, she expected she
would be drawn into the clique. On some accounts
she wished she might be, for she had already begun
to feel that where Marion was, there would be law
and order; but, on the whole, she was pleased to
see that her new pupil, while she was rapidly making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
her way into that most difficult of all positions
in a school to fill, that of general favorite, was doing
so without choosing any girl for her bosom friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;She helps me,&#8221; Miss Ashton thought with much
self-gratulation, &#8220;for she is not only a winsome,
merry girl, but a fine scholar, and already her
Christian influence begins to tell.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>AIDS TO EDUCATION.</h3>
</div>
<p>In the prospectus of Montrose Academy was the
following sentence:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The design of Montrose Academy is the nurture
of Christian women.</p>
<p>&#8220;To this great object they dedicate the choicest
instruction, the noblest personal influences, and the
refinements of a cultivated home.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was to carry out this, that religious instruction
was made prominent.</p>
<p>Not only was the Bible a weekly text-book for
careful and critical study, but, in accordance with an
established custom of the school, among the distinguished
men and women who nearly every week gave
lectures or addresses to the young ladies, were to be
found those who told them of the religious movements
and interests of the day. Not only those of
our own country, but those of a broader field, covering
all the known world.</p>
<p>Returned missionaries, with their pathetic stories
of their past life.</p>
<p>Heads of the great philanthropic societies, each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
one with its claim of special and immediate importance.</p>
<p>Professors for theological seminaries and from
prominent colleges, discussing the prevailing questions
that were agitating the public mind.</p>
<p>Trained scholars in the scientific world, laden with
their rich treasures of research into nature&#8217;s hidden
secrets.</p>
<p>Musicians of wide repute, who found an inspiration
in the glowing young faces before them, that called
from them their choicest and their best.</p>
<p>Elocutionists, with their pathetic and humorous
readings, always finding a ready response in their
delighted audience.</p>
<p>These, and many others of notoriety, were brought
to the academy; for Miss Ashton had not been slow
in learning what is so valuable in modern teaching,&mdash;<i>variety</i>.</p>
<p>If there were fewer prayer-meetings in the corridors
among pupils and teachers than in olden times,
there was in the school more alertness of mind, a
steadier, stronger ability to think, and, consequently,
to study, and, therefore, judiciously used, more power
to grasp, believe in, and love the great Christianity
to whose service the academy was dedicated.</p>
<p>Nor was it by these lectures alone that the educational
advantages were broadened.</p>
<p>The library every year received often large and
important additions. It would have been curious to
note the difference between the literature selected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
now, and that chosen years ago. Then a work of
fiction would have been considered entirely out of
place on the shelves of a library consecrated to religious
training. Now the pupils had free access to
the best works of the best literary authors of the
day, in fiction or otherwise. Monthly magazines
and newspapers were spread upon the library table.
There was but one thing required, that no book
taken out should be injured, and that no reading
should interfere with the committal of the lessons.</p>
<p>In the art gallery the same growth was readily
to be seen. The portraits of the early missionaries
who had gone out from the school, and whose names
had become sainted in the religious world, still hung
there; but the walls were covered now with choice
paintings,&mdash;donations from the rapidly increasing
alumn&aelig;, and from friends of the school. Here the
art scholars found much to interest and instruct
them, not only in the pictures, but in the models
and designs, which had been selected with both taste
and skill.</p>
<p>There was a cabinet of minerals; but this was by
no means a favorite with the pupils, though here and
there a diligent student might be seen possibly reading
&#8220;sermons in the stones,&#8221; who could tell!</p>
<p>There seemed, indeed, nothing to be wanting for
the &#8220;higher education&#8221; for which the institution was
designed, but that the pupils should accept and
improve the privileges offered them.</p>
<p>Marion Parke was not the only one who found herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
confused by the sudden wealth of opportunity
surrounding her. Other pupils had come from the
north and the south, the east and the west, many from
homes where few, if any, of the advantages of modern
life had been known. That Marion should have
appreciated, and to some extent have appropriated,
them as readily as she did, is a matter of surprise,
unless her educated Eastern parents are remembered,
also the amenities of her parsonage home. Certain
it is, that watching her as so many did, and as is the
common fate of every new pupil, there was not
detected any of the &#8220;verdancy&#8221; which so often
stamps and injures the young girl. It was the girl
next to her who leaned both elbows on the table, and
put her food into a capacious mouth on the blade of
her knife.</p>
<p>It was the one nearly opposite her that talked with
her mouth so full she had difficulty in making herself
understood; and another, half-way up the table,
to whom Miss Barton, the teacher who presided, had
occasion to say, when the girl, having handled several
pieces of cake in the cake-basket, chose the
largest and the best,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever we touch here, Maria, we take.&#8221;</p>
<p>A hard thing for Miss Barton to say, and for the
girl to hear; but it must be remembered that this
is a training as well as a finishing school, and that
there is an old adage with much truth in it, that
&#8220;manners make the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may seem a thing almost unnecessary and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
unkind to suggest, that even the most brilliant
scholarship could not give a girl a high standing
in a school of this kind, if it were unaccompanied
with the thousand little marks of conduct which
attest the lady.</p>
<p>Maria, after her rebuke from Miss Barton, left
the table in a noisy flood of tears, of course the sympathy
of all the girls going with her. Miss Barton
was pale, and there were tears in her eyes; but no
one noticed her, unless it was to throw toward her
disapproving looks.</p>
<p>The fact was, that she had spoken to Maria again
and again, kindly and in private, about this same
piece of ill-manners, and the girl had paid no heed to
it. There seemed nothing to be left to her but the
public rebuke, which, wounding, might cure.</p>
<p>Marion took the whole in wonderingly. Was this,
then, considered a part of that education for which
purpose what seemed to her such a wealth of treasures
had been gathered?</p>
<p>Here were lectures, libraries, art galleries, beautiful
grounds, excellent teachers, a bevy of happy
companions, and yet among them so small a thing
as a girl&#8217;s handling cake at the table, and choosing
the largest and the best piece, was made a matter of
comment and reproof, and, for the first time since
she had been in the academy, had raised a little
storm of rebellion on the part of pupils towards a
teacher.</p>
<p>When she went to her room, Susan had already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
told the others, who sat at different tables, what
had happened. Susan was excited and angry, but
Dorothy said quietly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why should Maria have taken the best bit
of cake, even if it had been on the top? I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No: you would have been the last girl in the
school to take the best of anything,&#8221; said Gladys,
giving Dorothy a hug and a kiss; &#8220;and as for Miss
Barton, she&#8217;s a dear, anyway, and I dare say she
feels at this moment twice as bad as Maria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensible girl, am I not, Marion?&#8221; seeing Marion
come into the room. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you take sides in
any such things; you mind what I say! Teachers
know what they are doing; and if any of us are reproved,
why, the long and short of it is, nine times
out of ten we deserve it. It&#8217;s &#8216;for the improvement
of our characters&#8217; that everything is done here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; said Marion heartily; and, trifling
as the event was, she put it with the long array of
educational advantages which she had come from the
far West to seek. &#8220;It requires attention to little
as well as great things&#8221;&mdash;she thought, wisely for a
girl of sixteen&mdash;&#8220;to accomplish the object of this
finishing-school.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>DEMOSTHENIC CLUB.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well! what of that! If college boys can have
secret societies, and the Faculties, to say the least,
wink at them, why can&#8217;t academy girls? I don&#8217;t
see!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Jenny Barton said one evening to a
group of girls out in the pretty grove back of the
academy building.</p>
<p>There were six of them there. Jenny had culled
them from the school, as best fitted for her purpose.
She had two brothers in Harvard College,
and she had been captivated by their stories of the
&#8220;Hasty Pudding Club,&#8221; of which they were both
members. &#8220;So much fun! such a jolly good time!
why not, then, for girls, as well as for boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>When, after the long summer vacation, Jenny
came back to school to establish one of these societies,
to be called in after years its founder, and
at the present time to be its head, this was the
height of her ambition, the one thing that she determined
to accomplish. These six girls that in the
gloaming of this September night are waiting to
hear what she has to say were well chosen. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
was Lucy Snow, the one great mischief-maker in
the school. No teacher but wished her out of her
corridor; in truth, no teacher, not even Miss Ashton,
who never shrank from the task of trying to
make over spoiled pupils, was glad to see her back
at the beginning of a new year. There was Kate
Underwood, a brilliant girl, a fine scholar, and the
best writer in the school. There was Martha Dodd,
whose parents were missionaries at Otaheite; but
Martha will never put her foot on missionary ground.
There was Sophy Kane, who held her head very
high because she was second cousin of Kane, the
Arctic explorer, and who talked in a grand manner
of what she intended to do in her future. There
was Mamie Smythe, &#8220;chock-full of fun,&#8221; the girls
said, and was never afraid, teachers or no teachers,
rules or no rules, of carrying it out. There was
Lilly White, red as a peony, large as a travelling
giantess, with hands that had to have gloves made
specially to fit them, and feet that couldn&#8217;t hide themselves
even in a number ten boot. She was as good-natured
as she was uncouth, and never happier than
when she was being made a butt of. These were to
be the nucleus around which this society was to be
formed; and as they threw themselves down on the
bed of pine-leaves which carpeted the old stump of a
tree upon which Jenny Barton was seated, they were
the most characteristic group that could have been
chosen out of the school. Jenny had shown her
powers of leadership when she made the selection.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>The opening sentence of this chapter was what
she said in reply to some objection which Kate
Underwood had offered. Kate liked to be popular,
to be admired and courted for her talents: it was the
<i>secret</i> society that would prevent this. This, Jenny
Barton understood; and in the long debate that
followed she met it well.</p>
<p>There should be a public occasion now and then.
Did not the Harvard societies give splendid spreads,
and have an abundance of good times generally?</p>
<p>The society was established, and its name, after a
long and warm debate, chosen: &#8220;The Demosthenic
Club.&#8221; &#8220;For we are going to debate, you know;
train for lecturers, public readers, ministers, actresses,
lawyers, and whatever needs public speaking,&#8221;
said President Jenny. Vice-President Kate
Underwood gave her head an expressive toss, and, if
it hadn&#8217;t been too dark to see her smile, there might
have been seen something more than the toss; for
while they talked, the long twilight had faded away,
the little ripples of the lake by whose side they were
sitting had gone to sleep on its quiet bosom. The air
was full of the chirrup of innumerable insects; two
frogs, creeping up from the water, adding a sonorous
bass, and the long, slender pine-leaves chimed into
this evening lullaby with their sad, sweet, &AElig;olian
notes.</p>
<p>But little of all of this did this Demosthenic Club
notice as, coming out at length from the darkness of
the grove, they saw the sky full of stars, the academy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
windows blazing with gas-light, and knew study
hours had been begun.</p>
<p>Not to be in their rooms punctually at that hour
was an infringement upon the &#8220;regulations&#8221; not
easily excused, and to begin the formation of their
society by incurring the displeasure of their teachers
did not promise well for their future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your boots,&#8221; whispered Mamie Smythe,
as they stood hesitating at the door. In a moment
every pair of boots was in the girls&#8217; hands, and they
were creeping softly through the empty corridors
toward their respective rooms. As fate would have
it, the only one who reached her room was Lilly
White. To be sure, Fr&auml;ulein Sausmann, the German
teacher, heard steps in her corridor, and, opening her
door a crack, peeped out. When she saw Lilly
White creeping along on the toes of her great feet,
her boots, like two boats, held one in each hand, she
only smiled, and said to herself, &#8220;Oh, Fr&auml;ulein
White! She matters not. She studies no times at
all,&#8221; and shut her door.</p>
<p>All the others were taken in the very act; and
their shoeless feet, their confession of a guilty conscience,
were reported to Miss Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven of the girls! that means a conspiracy of
some sort,&#8221; said this wise teacher. &#8220;I must keep
an eye upon them.&#8221;</p>
<p>How much any one of this &#8220;Demosthenic Club&#8221;
suspected of their detection by their corridor teachers
it would be difficult to say, for, except by a glance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
no notice was taken of them at the time. Jenny
Barton told the others triumphantly at their next
secret session, how she had hidden her shoes behind
her, and taken little, mincing steps, so to hide her
feet, and imitated the whole performance, much to
the amusement of the others. &#8220;Ah, but!&#8221; said
Mamie Smythe, &#8220;that wasn&#8217;t half as good as what
I did. When I met Miss Stearns pat in the face,
and she looked me through and through with those
great goggle eyes of hers, I just said, &#8216;O Miss
Stearns, I was so thirsty I couldn&#8217;t study; I had to
go and get a drink of ice-water!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the ugly old thing stared at the boots I had
forgotten to hide, as much as to say, &#8216;It was very
necessary, in order to go over these uncarpeted floors,
to take off your boots, I suppose, Mamie Smythe!&#8217;
If she had only said so right out, I should have
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, Miss Stearns, I did it so not to make a
noise;&#8217; that&#8217;s true, isn&#8217;t it, now?&#8221; looking round
among the laughing girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you ought to have added,&#8221; put in Kate
Underwood, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t want to disturb any one
in study hours; that was true, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly what I would have said; but then, when
she only goggle-eyed me, what could a girl do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? Why, do what I did,&#8221; said Lucy Snow. &#8220;I
walked right up to Miss Palmer, she&#8217;s so ill-natured,
and likes so much to have us all hate her, that you
can do anything with her, and I said,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Palmer! I know it&#8217;s study hours, but I ate
too much of that berry shortcake for tea, and I went
to find the matron, to see if she couldn&#8217;t give me
something to ease the pain.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I think&#8217; said she (the horrid thing), &#8216;if you
would put on your boots, it might alleviate the pain;
but for fear it should not&mdash;you didn&#8217;t find the
matron, I suppose?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t see her; I had to
come away no better than I went.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am very sorry for you; you appear to be in
great pain.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was doubling up like&mdash;like a contortionist,&#8221;
and she smiled, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come into my room, as you can&#8217;t find the
matron, perhaps I can help you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So in I had to go; and, girls, if you can believe
it, after fumbling around among her phials, she
brought me something in a tumbler. It was half
full and looked horrid! I tell you, I shook in my
stocking feet, and I began to straighten up, and
whimpered,&mdash;I could have cried right out, it looked
so awful, so <i>awful</i>, but I only whimpered,&mdash;&#8216;I&#8217;m
better, a good deal, Miss Palmer; I&#8217;ll go to my room,
and if I can&#8217;t study, I&#8217;ll go to bed.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You must take this first. I don&#8217;t like to send
you away in such severe pain, particularly as you
couldn&#8217;t find the matron, without doing something
to help you. You know I am responsible to your
parents for your health!&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My parents never give me any medicine,&#8217; I
snarled, for I was getting ruxy by this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Perhaps you would have enjoyed better health if
they had, and would have been less liable to these
sudden attacks of pain,&#8217; she said; and, girls, if you
can believe it, when I looked up in her face, there
she was in a broad grin, holding the tumbler, too,
close to my mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m lots better,&#8217; I whimpered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m glad to hear it,&#8217; the ugly old thing said; &#8216;but
I must insist on your drinking this at once, or I shall
have to take you down to Miss Ashton&#8217;s room; she is
more responsible than I am, and I am sure would not
pass any neglect on my part over.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;By this time the tumbler touched my lips, and,
girls, I was so sure that she would take me down to
Miss Ashton,&mdash;and there is no such thing as keeping
anything away from her, for you know how she hates
what she calls a &#8216;prevarication,&#8217;&mdash;that I just had my
choice, to drink that nasty stuff, or to betray the
Demosthenic Club, or to tell a fib, and have my
walking-ticket given me, so I opened my mouth
wide, and swallowed one swallow, then was going to
turn away my head, but Miss Palmer held the
tumbler tight to my lips, as I have seen people
do to children when they were giving castor oil.
I took another, and tried again, but there was the
tumbler tighter still, so down with it I went, and&mdash;and&mdash;she
had no mercy; she made me drain it to
the last drop; then she put it on the table, and said,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now, Lucy, you can go to your room; I think
you will feel well enough to study your lesson, but if
you do not, come back in a half-hour, and I will give
you another, and a stronger dose. Put on your boots
before you go; you may take cold on the bare floors,
in your condition. Good-night.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She opened her door, and held it open in the
politest way until I had passed out, then I heard
her laugh&mdash;laugh out loud, a real merry, ringing
laugh, every note of which said as plainly as words
could,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve caught you now, old lady. How is the pain?
Did the medicine help you?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, girls, it was the hardest pain I ever
had in my life, and I never want another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us how the medicine tasted,&#8221; said Lilly
White.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tasted! why, like rhubarb, castor oil, assaf&oelig;tida,
ginger, mustard, epicac, boneset, paregoric, quinine,
arsenic, rough on rats, and every other hideous
medicine in the pharmacop&oelig;ia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough for you; you oughtn&#8217;t to have lied,&#8221;
said Martha Dodd, her missionary blood telling for
the moment.</p>
<p>But the other girls only laughed; the joke on
Lucy was a foretaste of the fun which this club
was to inaugurate.</p>
<p>Now, if Miss Palmer did not report to Miss Ashton,
and she break up the whole thing, how splendid it
would be!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Undaunted, as after a week nothing had been
said to them in the way of disapproval, they went on
to choose the other members of the club; to appoint
times and places for meeting; and to organize in as
methodic and high-sounding a manner as their limited
experience would allow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>MISS ASHTON&#8217;S ADVICE.</h3>
</div>
<p>That the formation of such an insignificant thing
as this Demosthenic Club should have affected
girls like Dorothy Ottley and Marion Parke would
have seemed impossible; but it was destined to in
ways and times that were beyond their control.
When the club was making its selection of members,
among those most sought were Marion and Dorothy.
Marion, with her cheery, social Western manners,
made her way rapidly into one of those favoritisms
which are so common in girls&#8217; boarding-schools.
She always had a pleasant word for every one, and
always was ready to do a kind, generous act. She was
so pretty, too, and dressed so simply and neatly, that
there was nothing to find fault with, even if the girls
had not been, as girls are, in truth, as a class, generous,
noble, on the alert to see what is good, rather
than what is otherwise, in those with whom they live.
As for Dorothy, she was the model girl of the school.
The teachers trusted and loved her, so did the pupils.
No one among them all said how the sea had browned
and almost roughened her plain face; how hard work,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
anxiety, and poor fare had stunted her growth; how
carrying the cross children, too big and too heavy,
had given a stoop to her delicate shoulders, and
knots on her hands, that told too plainly of burdens
they were unable to lift. All that the school saw or
thought of was the gentle love that was always in
the large gray eyes, the kind words that the firm
lips never failed to speak, and the steady, straightforward,
honorable life of the best scholar.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can only get those two,&#8221; said President
Jenny Barton, &#8220;our club is made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are so good, they&#8217;ll spoil the fun,&#8221; said
Mamie Smythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; said Martha Dodd. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
suppose the daughter of a missionary would join a
club of which good girls could not be members!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or the cousin of so famous a man as Kane, the
Arctic explorer,&#8221; said Sophy Kane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dispute, girls; we seem to spend half our
time wrangling,&#8221; and the president knocked, with
what she made answer for the speaker&#8217;s gavel, noisily
on the table. &#8220;I nominate our vice-president, Miss
Underwood, to inform these young ladies of their
having been chosen, and to report from them at our
next meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the nomination accepted?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay! ay!&#8221; from the club.</p>
<p>In accordance with this request, Kate Underwood
had interviewed Marion and Dorothy secretly, and
had received from both a positive refusal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have no time for secret societies,&#8221; said
Dorothy with a good-natured laugh. &#8220;I want twice
as many hours for my studies. Thank you, all the
same, Kate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secret society! what is that?&#8221; asked Marion.
&#8220;What is it secret for? What do you do in it that
you don&#8217;t want to have known? I don&#8217;t like the
secret part of it. My father used to tell me about
the secret societies in Yale College, and they were
full of boys&#8217; scrapes. He nearly got turned out of
college for his part in one of them; and if I should
get turned out from here, it would break his heart.
No, thank you, I&#8217;d better not.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, sure that <i>no</i> from them meant no, Kate had
reported to the club, and received permission to
invite Susan Downer and Gladys Philbrick in their
places.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sue will come of course, and be glad to,&#8221; the
club said. &#8220;Really, on the whole, she will be better
than Dorothy, for Dorothy always wants to toe the
line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of Gladys, they by no means felt so sure. &#8220;She
is, and she isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Lucy Snow said; &#8220;but she has
lots of money, and that means splendid spreads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she won&#8217;t&mdash;she won&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;Martha Dodd
stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t what?&#8221; asked the president in a most
dignified manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t go through the corridors with her boots
in her hands,&#8221; said Mamie with a rueful face, &#8220;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
get dosed. She&#8217;d stamp right along into Miss
Ashton&#8217;s room, and say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Ashton, I&#8217;m late. Mark me, will you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will keep us straight, then. I vote for
Gladys;&#8221; and the first to hold up her hands&mdash;both
of them&mdash;was Missionary Dodd.</p>
<p>So Gladys and Susan were invited to become
members of the club, and accepted gladly, not
knowing their room-mates had declined the same
honor.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the club was to influence
the rooms.</p>
<p>October, the regal month, when nature puts on
her most precious vestments, dons her crowns of
gold, clothes herself in scarlet robes, with girdles of
richest browns, has a half-hushed note of sadness in
the anthems she sings through the dropping leaves,
listens for the farewell of departing birds, and tries
in vain to call back to the browning earth the dying
flowers. This month was always considered in Montrose
Academy the time for settling down to hard
work in earnest. Vacation, with its rest and its
pleasures, seemed far behind the life of the two
hundred young girls who had entered into, and been
absorbed by, the present, and who were roused by
ambitions for the future.</p>
<p>Marion&#8217;s room-mates went thoroughly into the
work required of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your faithfulness during the first six weeks of
the term,&#8221; Miss Ashton had said to them in one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
her morning talks, &#8220;will determine your standard
for the year. Do not any of you think you can be
indolent now, and pick up your neglected studies
by and by.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may trust my experience when I tell you
that, in the whole number of years since I have
been connected with this school, I never knew a
pupil who failed in her duties during the first half of
the first term of the year, who afterwards did, indeed
could, make up the lost opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only what you lose out of the passing
recitation that you can never find again, but, of even
more consequence, it is what you lose in forming
honest, faithful habits of study.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many different ways of studying. I
have often tried to make these plain to you. I will
repeat them. First, learn to give your whole attention
to your lesson; <i>fix your mind upon it</i>. This
sounds as if it would be an easy thing to do; but,
in truth, it is very difficult. I am sorry to say I do
not think there are a dozen girls among you who
can do this successfully, even after years of training.
You can train your body to accomplish wonders, but
it is hard to believe that the mind is even more
capable of being brought into subjection by the will
than the body; and, to do that, to make your mind
your servant, is to accomplish the greatest result of
your education. Only as far as your study and your
general life here do that, are they of any true value
to you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will ask me how are you to fix your attention
when there are so many things going on around
you to distract your thoughts? I can only answer,
that as our minds are in many respects of different
orders, so, no general rule can be given. If you will,
each one, faithfully make the attempt, I have no
doubt you will succeed, in just the same proportion
as you are faithful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be as well, as I consider this the keystone
of all good study, that I should leave the other helps
and hindrances for some future talk; and it will give
me a great deal of pleasure if I can hear from any
of you at the end of a week&#8217;s trial, that you have
found yourselves helped by my advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>It speaks well for Miss Ashton&#8217;s influence over
her school that there was not a pupil there who was
not moved by what she had said.</p>
<p>To be sure, its effect was not equally apparent.
There were some who had scant minds to fix, and
what nature had been niggardly in bestowing, they
had frittered away in a trifling life; but for the
earnest girls, those who truly longed to make the
most of themselves and to be able to do a worthy
work in the life before them, such advice became at
once a help.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like my mother&#8217;s letter to me,&#8221;
Marion Parke said to Dorothy, as they went together
to their room. &#8220;She insists that it is not so
much the facts we learn, as the help they give us in
the use of our minds. I wonder if all educated people
think the same?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All thoroughly educated people I am sure do,&#8221;
answered Dorothy. &#8220;Sometimes I feel as if my
mind was a musical instrument; and if I didn&#8217;t know
every note in it, the only sounds I should ever hear
from it would be discords,&#8221;&mdash;at which rather Irish
comparison, both girls laughed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CHOOSING A PROFESSION.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was one peculiarity of Montrose Academy
that had been slow to recommend itself to the parents
of its pupils. That was the elective system, which
was adopted after much controversy on the part of
the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The more conservative insisted that the prosperity
of the past had shown the wisdom of keeping strictly
to a curriculum that did not allow individual choice
of studies. The newer element in the Board were
equally sure that to oblige a girl to go through a
course of Latin and Greek, of higher mathematics, of
logic and geology, who, on leaving school, would
never have the slightest use for them, was simply a
waste of time. A compromise was made at length,
by which, for five years, the elective system should
be practised, it being claimed that no shorter time
could fairly prove its success or its failure; and during
this period certain studies of the old course should
be insisted upon. First and foremost the Bible, the
others chosen to depend upon the class.</p>
<p>The year of Marion&#8217;s entering the school was the
second of the experiment; and, after joining the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
middle class and having her regular lessons assigned
to her, she was not a little surprised, and in truth
confused, by Miss Ashton asking her, as if it was a
matter of course, &#8220;What do you intend to <i>do</i> in the
future?&#8221; as if she expected her to have her future
all mapped out, and was to begin at once her preparation
for it. Miss Ashton saw her embarrassment, and
helped her by saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the young ladies come here with very
definite plans; for instance, your room-mate Dorothy
is fitting for a teacher, and a very fine one she will
make! Gladys is making special study of everything
pertaining to natural science,&mdash;geology, botany, physics,
and chemistry. She intends when she goes back
to Florida to become an agriculturist. I dare say you
have already heard her talk of the wonderful possibilities
to be found there. Her father is an enthusiast
in the work, and she means to fit herself to be
his able assistant. Susan wants to be a banker, and
avails herself of every help she can find toward it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see our little lame girl Helen! She is to be
an artist, and devotes all her spare time to courses
in art. She is in the second year, and has made
wonderful progress in shading in charcoal from casts
and models. She uses paints, both oils and watercolors,
but those do not come in our regular course.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we see any special talent in a pupil in any
line, we do not confine ourselves to what we can do
for her, but we call in extra help from abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kate Underwood is to be a lawyer. Mamie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Smythe has a new chosen profession for every new
year, but as she is an only child, and her mother is
wealthy, she will never enter one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might go on through perhaps an eighth of the
school, and point out to you girls who are studying
with an aim. For the greater number, they are content
to go on with the regular curriculum; as their
only object, and that of their parents for them,
seems to be to secure sufficient education to make
them pass creditably through the common life of
ordinary women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you might have a definite object in
view; and as you are now fairly started in your
classes, and, as your teachers tell me, are doing very
well, if you had a plan, you could find time to choose
such other studies as would help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was new to Marion; she asked for time to
think it over, which Miss Ashton gladly allowed her.</p>
<p>She had in her heart made her choice, but that,
with all the other advantages offered, she could do
anything except in a general way to help this choice
forward, she had never dreamed. Her room-mates
noticed how silent and thoughtful she was after her
talk with Miss Ashton, and wondered what could be
the cause, surely she was too faithful and far too
good a scholar for any remissness that would have
to be rebuked; but no one asked her a question.</p>
<p>It was after two days that Marion wrote her mother,
and her letter caused a great surprise in the Western
parsonage. This is in part what she wrote:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Miss Ashton has asked me what I am to <i>do</i> in the future. It
seems they not only give you the regular curriculum, but are ready to
allow you elective studies, by which you can fit yourself for your particular
future.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;I wonder if you will think me a foolish girl when I write you that,
if you both approve, I should like to be a doctor! Don&#8217;t laugh!
I have seen so much sickness that there was no really educated
physician to relieve, and am, as you have so often called me, &#8216;a regular
born nurse,&#8217; that the profession, if a profession I am capable of
acquiring, seems very tempting to me. There is no hurry in the decision,
only please think it over, and write me your advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not long before an answer came:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;You are quite capable of choosing for yourself;
and if you turn naturally to the medical profession,
you will have our full approval of your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Marion read this, she felt as if she had
grown suddenly many years older. She looked carefully
over the list of studies, to see from which she
could gain the greatest help, and in a short time
after her conversation with Miss Ashton she reported
herself as a future M.D.</p>
<p>This was not a rare profession for a young girl to
choose. Miss Ashton knew that already there were
a number with that in view. What she doubted was,
whether a quarter of them would ever carry out their
intention; and this was one thing which, favoring on
the whole as she did the elective system, she could
but acknowledge told against it,&mdash;the uncertainty
which their youth, and the natural tendency of a
girl&#8217;s mind to change, gave. She had known them
in one year, or even a shorter time, an enthusiast in
one profession, then, becoming tired of it, and sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
another was more suited to their abilities, turn to
the new choice.</p>
<p>One thing, however, was certain: she comforted
herself by remembering, that the mental discipline
which they had acquired would stay with them, even
after the whim of the time had ceased to influence
them.</p>
<p>There was an immediate effect, however, which
Marion&#8217;s decision had upon her. It interested her
in those of her schoolmates who were looking forward
to a definite and useful future. She could
recall now how often her room-mates had spoken
of what they intended to do, but she had only listened
to it as she had to what they said about their
homes and their friends.</p>
<p>How it became known to them that she, too, had
made her choice for the future, she wondered over;
but it was not long before they began to call her
&#8220;Dr!&#8221; as if she had already earned the title.</p>
<p>Nellie Blair Gorham she had from the first of her
entering the school taken a deep interest in. The
small, deformed, pale girl had a pathos in her whole
appearance that touched deeply Marion&#8217;s sympathies.
They were in different classes, and, so far, had come
little in contact; but now she felt irresistibly drawn
to the art studio during the hours when Helen was
there, and, standing near, watched her as she worked.</p>
<p>Helen had all the shrinking sensitiveness which
her misfortunes and her poverty&mdash;for she was poor&mdash;would
naturally give her. Marion was strong of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
body, and strong of mind, with a gentle, loving, sympathetic
nature speaking from every look and action;
the one, the counterpart of the other.</p>
<p>Marion made an immediate choice, under Miss
Ashton&#8217;s instruction, of the studies that would help
her in the future; and so, with redoubled interest in
this school-life, she bent to her work, learning day
by day the value of trying to fasten her mind upon
that, and that alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>VISIT OF COUSIN ABIJAH.</h3>
</div>
<p>One afternoon when Marion&#8217;s lessons had proved
unusually difficult, her room-mates noisy, and obstacles
everywhere, it seemed to the diligent scholar,
she answered a tap on her door, to find Etta Lawrence,
the girl who waited in the hall to announce
visitors, with a face full of amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man down-stairs asking for you,
Marion,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He started to follow me up-stairs;
and when I showed him into the parlor, and
told him I would call you, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no odds, I can jist as well go up; I ain&#8217;t
afraid of stairs, no way.&#8217; I had hard work to make
him go into the parlor, and I left him sitting on the
edge of a chair, staring around as if he never had
seen such a room before.&#8221; Then Etta burst into a
merry laugh, in which all the others but Marion
joined: she stood still, looking from one of the girls
to another, as if she couldn&#8217;t imagine what it all
meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go down to the parlor,&#8221; said Dorothy,
seeing her hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some one from out West,&#8221; added Sue.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/illus-069.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 363px; height: 582px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 363px;'>
&#8220;Did you wish to see me?&#8221; asked Marion, looking inquiringly at the man. Page 69. <i>Miss Ashton&#8217;s New Pupil.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s your father. Hurry! hurry!&#8221; said
Gladys, thinking how she would hurry if her own
father had been there.</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Marion, with heightened color
and a rapidly beating heart, followed Etta down into
the parlor, and there, still seated on the edge of his
chair, twirling an old felt hat rapidly round between
two big, red hands, she saw a tall, lean man in a suit
of coarse gray clothes. He had grizzly, iron-gray
hair, stubby white whiskers, a pale-blue eye, a brown
face streaked with red.</p>
<p>He sat a little nearer the front edge of his chair
as she entered the room, and waited for her to speak.
Evidently he was not prepared for the kind of Western
girl he saw before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you wish to see me?&#8221; looking inquiringly at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be you Marion Parke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Abijah Jones, your cousin, three times removed;
your great-aunt Betty told me to come out
here and make a call on you. She&#8217;s set on seeing
you at Thanksgiving, and I guess you&#8217;d better humor
her, for she took a spite at your father cause he
wouldn&#8217;t farm it, and would have an education; but
she allers kind of favored him more than the rest of
us, and has allers hankered after him. That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Cousin Abijah,&#8221; her Western
hospitality coming to her rescue. &#8220;Tell me about
my Aunt Betty; she is well, I hope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Once launched upon the subject of Aunt Betty,
between whom and himself there seemed to have
been always a family war, he began to feel entirely
at home in his strange surroundings, his voice rising
to a pitch that resounded through the large room
with a peculiar nasal twang Marion had never heard
before. She saw one face after another make its
appearance through the half-open door, and she knew
very well this unusual visitor was giving a great deal
of amusement to those who saw him.</p>
<p>Accustomed to see rude characters at the West as
she was, never before had Marion met one who
seemed to her so utterly oblivious of all common
proprieties. She felt sure that if he remained long,
the whole school would be made aware of his peculiar
presence; and though she struggled hard not to be
ashamed of him, and to make his call as pleasant as
she could, she was much relieved when she saw Miss
Ashton, who, hearing the strident voice, had come to
ascertain its source.</p>
<p>As a New England woman, she at once recognized
the type. Marion could only introduce him as her
&#8220;Cousin Abijah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three times removed,&#8221; put in Cousin Abijah,
without rising from his chair, only twirling his hat
a little faster in Miss Ashton&#8217;s stately presence.</p>
<p>She held her hand out to him cordially, and when
he put his great brown knotty fist within it, a dull
red color came slowly into his seamed face. It was
not from any want of self-respect, far from it; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
would not have been abashed if Queen Victoria with
all her court in full dress had entered the room. A
real out-and-out country New Englander knows no
peer the wide world over.</p>
<p>Seating herself near him, Miss Ashton soon drew
him into a pleasant conversation, to which Marion
listened in much surprise. Even the man&#8217;s voice
dropped to a lower pitch, and what he said lost the
asperity that had made it so disagreeable. After a
few minutes, she proposed to him to show him around
the building, where she was sure he would find much
to interest him, and, what was a very unusual thing
for her to do, she went with him herself. A visitor
of this kind was rare in the academy. She well knew
the amusement he would create, and when they met,
as they did often, groups of girls in the corridor, who
stared and smiled at her uncouth companion, she
silenced them by a look, which they could not fail to
understand.</p>
<p>Kind Miss Ashton! Marion, as well as Cousin
Abijah, will never forget it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Marion,&#8221; she said, when they returned to
the parlor, &#8220;I will excuse you from your next recitation,
and you can take your cousin over to the
neighboring city. There is a great deal for him to
see there, and I will give you a note which will admit
you to some of the large factories.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go with him to the station, and see him
off in the cars. You will come home, I know, safely
and punctually.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Then, if Cousin Abijah had been the President of
the United States she would not have bidden him a
more cordial &#8220;good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion, strengthened by Miss Ashton&#8217;s kindness,
invited her cousin before they left to visit her room.
She took him through the long corridors, fully conscious
that out of many doors curious eyes were
peeping at them as they passed, and that smiles,
sometimes giggles, followed them. Dorothy and
Gladys were both there, and made him pleasantly
welcome. He did not admire the view from the
window, as Marion expected, for he had had far finer
mountain views around him all his life; but he looked
curiously at the bric-a-brac and pictures, of which
the room was full, and will carry home with him
wonderful stories of the Western girl&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>Then came the visit to Pomfret, the inspection of
some of the finest mills, and of the pleasantest parts
of the manufacturing city; and Marion bade this
country cousin good-by, with the hearty hope that
his visit had been a pleasant one.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_TABLEAUX' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_TABLEAUX'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE TABLEAUX.</h3>
</div>
<p>Friday night, the work of the week being ended,
was given to the young ladies as a holiday evening,
which, within bounds, was entirely at their disposal.
No study was required of them, and it was generally
occupied by diversions of one kind and another, in
which the whole school were at liberty to join.
Sometimes it was a dance, the teachers enjoying it
as heartily as their pupils; sometimes it was a concert,
and generally it was well worth hearing, for this
academy was noted for its skilled musicians. Again,
it would be a play, even Antigone not being too
ambitious for these amateur actors or <i>tableaux
vivants</i>, which never failed to be amusing.</p>
<p>This night was one chosen by the Demosthenic
Club for their secret meetings. As its members did
not like to lose any of the social fun, these meetings
were held so secretly that every one in the building
knew of their time and place, much to the annoyance
of the club; and no one, so far, not even the club
itself, was better informed of what was done and
said there than Miss Ashton. It seemed to her a
harmless sort of an affair. There was no difference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
in the scholarship of its members, the sessions were
short, no mischief followed them, and if it made the
girls contented and happy it was all right.</p>
<p>How she came to have this perfect understanding
it would be difficult to tell, only she was found, in
some unknown and mysterious way, to always have
the reins in her own hands, no matter how restive
the colts she had to control.</p>
<p>The club had grown from the original number
of seven, to twelve, the new members having been
chosen from among the brightest and most mischievous
girls in school. This made Miss Ashton wonder
at their uniformly quiet behavior, and increased the
vigilance of her watch.</p>
<p>About three weeks after the visit of Cousin Abijah,
it was announced that a series of tableaux would
be given on Friday evening, illustrating a poem written
by Miss Kate Underwood.</p>
<p>Kate&#8217;s poetical abilities were well known and
greatly admired by the school, even the teachers
gave her credit for a knack at humorous sketches
rather unusual. She was to be, perhaps, a second
John Saxe, possibly an Oliver Wendell Holmes, who
could tell? The gift was worth cultivating, particularly
as it did not interfere with Kate&#8217;s soberer and
more disciplinary studies.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton did not think it necessary to see the
poem. It was probably witty, if not wise, and wisdom
need not intrude its grave face always into the freedom
of the Friday nights; indeed, she rather winked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
at the performance, as she and her associate principal
were to be out of town on that night, and &#8220;high
fun&#8221; in the hall served to keep the girls from any
more serious mischief.</p>
<p>All the club were pledged to the most profound
secrecy as to what the tableaux were to be; and, for
a wonder, there were no revelations made, even to
the &#8220;dear, intimate friend,&#8221; who was not a member,
and who generally shared the most &#8220;profound
secret,&#8221; no matter from what source it emanated.</p>
<p>After evening prayers, the hall was given to the
club, and as every arrangement had been made previously
for the decoration of the stage, the work was
completed and the doors thrown open at an early
hour.</p>
<p>The hall was soon filled, and the buzz of expectation
began long before the curtain was raised; when
it was, it showed an interior of a farm kitchen of the
olden times. Clothes-bars had been skilfully placed
so as to represent a low ceiling, and from them
depended hams wrapped in brown paper coverings,
sausages enclosed in cloth bags, herbs tied
in bunches and labelled in large letters, &#8220;Sage, Camomile,
Fennel, Dock, Caraway.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were ears of corn, sweet, Indian, pop,
likewise labelled; tomatoes, strung in rows to dry,
and strings also of newly sliced apple.</p>
<p>Under this motley ceiling the room showed plainly
it was the living-room of the house. There was a
large cooking-stove that shone so you might have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
seen your face in it, a row of wash-tubs, leaning bottom
side up against the wall, two wooden pails and
three tin ones, standing on a shelf over the tubs, and
these in close proximity to the only window in the
room. Just before this window was a small table
with a Bible, a well-worn one, on it, and a pair of
steel-bowed spectacles. One yellow wooden chair,
and what was called &#8220;a settle&#8221; near the stove, a
large cooking-table, and one more chair, made the
furniture of the room.</p>
<p>Before this table sat an old woman, dressed in a
black petticoat, and a red, short gown that came a
little below her waist. She wore a cap that fitted
close to her head, made of some black cloth, innocent
of bow or frill; from under it, locks of gray hung
down about her face and neck. She had a swarthy
skin, two small eyes, hidden by a large pair of glasses,
a mouth that kept in motion in spite of the necessity
of stillness which a tableau is supposed to demand,
as if she were reading the letter she held in her hand
aloud. The laugh and clapping which this scene
called forth had hardly subsided when, from behind
a hidden corner of the stage, a sweet, clear voice
began to read the descriptive poem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Kate Underwood herself,&#8221; was whispered
from seat to seat. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other girl in school
that can read as well as she can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poem gave a brief description of the kitchen
as it appeared on the stage, then a more lengthy one
of the old woman, with the contents of the letter she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
was reading. It was from a niece at a boarding-school,
who proposed, in a brief and direct way, to
visit this aunt during her coming vacation. The
tableau was acted so well, and with such piquancy,
that claps and peals of laughter from the audience,
and finally calls for &#8220;Kate Underwood,&#8221; who
demurely makes her appearance from behind the curtain,
drops a stage courtesy, and disappears. The
poem had been (this audience constituting the
judges) excellent, the very best thing Kate ever
wrote; and as for the tableaux, were there ever any
before one-half so good?</p>
<p>Now, while to almost all in the hall there had
been nothing said or done that could injure the feelings
of any one, to Marion Parke it seemed an unkind
take-off of her cousin during his recent visit
to her.</p>
<p>Something in the tall, gaunt girl, in her rough,
coarse dress, in the grotesque awkwardness of her
movements, reminded Marion of Cousin Abijah; and
while she had laughed with the others, and had refused
to allow her feelings to be hurt, she left the
hall uncomfortable and unhappy, wishing he had
never come, or that all the school had shown the
kind consideration of Miss Ashton; nor was she
helped in the least when she heard Susan telling in
great glee how the whole plan had come to them
after the visit of that uncouth old cousin of Marion
Parke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>GLADYS LEAVES THE CLUB.</h3>
</div>
<p>Dorothy was the first to see Marion at the door
of their room after the tableaux. She hoped she had
not heard what Sue had said, but that she had she
could not doubt when she saw the pained expression
on Marion&#8217;s face. In the after discussion of the
entertainment, Marion took no part, but went quietly
to her bed, with only a brief &#8220;good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have hurt her feelings, and they ought to
have been ashamed of themselves,&#8221; said kind Dorothy
to the two members of the club sitting beside
her. &#8220;Girls, if that is what you mean to do in your
Demosthenic Club, I am most thankful I never
joined it, and the sooner you both leave it the
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandmarm!&#8221; said Sue, her hot temper flashing
into her face, &#8220;when we want your advice, we will
ask it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Dody? Whose feelings are hurt, and
who ought to be ashamed of themselves?&#8221; asked
Gladys. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you are talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About Marion and the Demosthenic Club!&#8221;
answered Dorothy briefly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What for? What has Marion to do with the
club?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy looked straight into Gladys&#8217;s face for a
moment. Whatever other faults Gladys had, she
had never, even in trifles, been otherwise than
honest and straightforward. There was nothing in
her face now but surprise; so Dorothy, much relieved
that she was not a partaker in the unkindness,
explained to her that, as Susan had just told them,
the club had taken Marion&#8217;s country cousin for a
butt, and had made him, with the old aunt,&mdash;the
knowledge of whom must have come to them from
some one in their room,&mdash;the characters in the
farce; and that Marion, coming into the room just
as Susan was telling of it, had heard her; and it
had hurt her feelings.</p>
<p>Now, strange as it may seem, it was nevertheless
true that the club, knowing Gladys well, and how
impossible it would be for her to do anything that
might injure another, had carefully kept from her
any direct participation in it. She knew in a general
way what was to be done, but was ignorant of particulars.</p>
<p>No sooner had the whole been made known to her,
than without a word, though it was after the time
when the girls were allowed to leave their rooms,
without the slightest effort to move softly, she
passed the doors of several teachers, up into another
corridor, not stopping until she tapped at Jenny
Barton&#8217;s room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>The tap was followed by the muffled sound of
scurrying feet, of a table pulled hastily away, of
whispers intended to be soft, but in the hurry having
a strangely sibilant tone, that made them almost
words spoken aloud, to the impatient Gladys.</p>
<p>She rapped a second time, a little louder than the
first, and the door was opened by Jenny, in her nightdress.
The gas in the room was out, and there was
no one to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Gladys Philbrick!&#8221; she exclaimed crossly,
pulling Gladys hastily in; &#8220;you frightened us almost
out of our wits. Girls! it&#8217;s only Gladys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Out from under the beds and from the closets in
the two bedrooms crept one after another the girls
of the club. All were there but Susan and Gladys;
and they would have been invited, but it was well
known that if Gladys broke a rule of the school, she
never rested until she had made full confession to
one of the teachers. She was not to be trusted in
the least; and, of course, Susan could not be invited
without her, so the knowledge of the spread which
was to succeed the tableaux had been carefully kept
from them. No wonder at Jenny&#8217;s reception of her!</p>
<p>Somewhat staggered by this, and by the appearance
of the hidden, laughing girls, Gladys stood for
a moment staring blankly around her, then she asked,
singling Kate Underwood out from among the
others,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kate! did you write that poem to make fun of
Marion Parke&#8217;s country cousin?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221; answered Kate, turning
brusquely upon Gladys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, if you did, and if, as Sue says, you got
up those tableaux to make fun of him, I think you
are the meanest girl in the school; and as for the
club&mdash;a club that would do such a thing, I wouldn&#8217;t
be a member of a moment longer, not if you would
give me a million dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as we have no million to give you, and
wouldn&#8217;t part with even a copper to have you stay,
you can have your name taken off the roll any time,&#8221;
said the president majestically.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, it&#8217;s done then; but my question is not
answered. Kate Underwood, did, or did you not,
intend to make fun of Marion Parke&#8217;s cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I know by what right you ask me, I will
answer you; until then, Gladys Philbrick, will you be
kind enough to speak in a lower voice, unless you
wish to bring some of the teachers down upon us,
or perhaps you will report us to Miss Ashton; I
think she has just come in the late train, I heard a
carriage stop at the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know my right?&#8221; answered Gladys,
without taking any notice of Kate&#8217;s taunts. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the right of being ashamed to hold a girl up to ridicule
for what she couldn&#8217;t help, and a girl like
Marion Parke. I hoped you could say you didn&#8217;t
mean to; but I see you can&#8217;t.&#8221; Then Gladys, without
another word, left the room, leaving behind her
a set of girls who, to say the least, were not in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
mood to congratulate themselves on the events of
the evening.</p>
<p>The spread was hastily put on the table again, but
it was eaten by them with sober faces and troubled
hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sue, as Gladys came noisily into
their room, &#8220;now I suppose you&#8217;ve made all the
girls so mad they will never speak to me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told them what I think of them,&#8221; and
Gladys looked at Sue askance over her shoulder as
she spoke, &#8220;and I advise you to quit a club that can
be as unkind as this has been to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I want your advice I will ask it; I advise
you to keep it until then. Whom did you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of them, hiding under beds and in closets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means a spread without leave, and we not
invited. You&#8217;re a tell-tale Gladys; they are afraid
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Gladys with a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; said a gentle voice from the bedroom
door, &#8220;don&#8217;t mind; it&#8217;s foolish in me I dare say,
and&mdash;and the tableaux were real funny,&#8221; and an odd
attempt at a laugh ended in a burst of tears.</p>
<p>In a moment both of Gladys&#8217;s arms were around
Marion&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear, darling old Marion,&#8221; she said, whimpering
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much noise in this room!&#8221; said Miss Palmer&#8217;s
voice at their door. &#8220;I did not expect this,
Marion! Dorothy, what does it mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to bed, Miss Palmer,&#8221; said Dorothy,
opening the door immediately. &#8220;It was about
the tableaux we were talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have been in bed half an hour ago;
I am sorry to be obliged to report you. Let this
never happen again. Your room has been in most
respects a model room until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a girl spoke, and if Miss Palmer had come
again fifteen minutes later, she would have found the
gas out and the girls in bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>KATE UNDERWOOD&#8217;S APOLOGIES.</h3>
</div>
<p>The scholars noticed that when Miss Ashton came
into the hall a few nights after the Friday evening
tableaux she looked very grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s gone wrong? Who has been making
trouble? Look at the girls that belong to the
Demosthenic Club! I&#8217;m glad I am not a member!&#8221;</p>
<p>These, and various other remarks, passed from one
to the other, as Miss Ashton walked through the hall
to her seat on the platform.</p>
<p>It was the hour for evening prayers. Usually she
read a short psalm, but to-night she chose the twelfth
chapter of Romans, stopping at the tenth verse, and
looking slowly around the school as she repeated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly
love; in honour preferring one another.&#8217;&#8221; Then
she closed her Bible and repeated these verses:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;These things I command you, That you love one
another. Let love be without dissimulation. Love
worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law. By love serve one another.
But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith. And I pray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
that your love may abound more and more in knowledge
and in all judgment. Fulfil ye my joy, that ye
be like minded, having the same love, being of one
accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through
strife or vain glory, but in lowliness of mind let each
esteem other better than himself. Look not every
man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others. Let this mind be in you which
was also in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But as touching brotherly love ye need not that
I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of
God to love one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of
God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and
knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not
God; for God is love.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hesitate,&#8221; said Miss Ashton, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, &#8220;to add anything to these expressive and solemn
Bible words. They convey in the most forcible
way what seems to me the highest good for which
we can aim in this life,&mdash;the perfection of Christian
character.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume you all realize in some degree the world
we make here by ourselves. Set apart in a great
measure from what is going on around us, closely
connected in all our interests, we depend upon each
other for our happiness, our growth, our well-being.
We are helped, or we are hindered, by what in a large
sphere might pass us by. Nothing is too small to
be of vital importance to us; the aggregate of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
influences is made up of trifles. I have said this same
thing to you time and time again, and yet I am sorry
to find how soon it can be forgotten. If I could impress
upon you these tender, beautiful gospel truths
I have repeated, I should have had no occasion to detain
you to-night. You would all of you have been bearing
one another&#8217;s burdens, instead of laying one
upon delicate shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Taught of God to love one another.&#8217; Do those
learn the lesson God teaches who, without, we will
say, bearing any ill-will, injure the feelings of others?
It may be by unkind words; it may be by an intentional
rudeness; it may be by neglect; it may be by a
criticism spoken secretly, slyly, circulated wittily,
laughed at, but not forgotten. &#8216;The ways that are
unlovely;&#8217; how numerous they are, and how directly
they tend to make hearts ache, and lives unhappy,
no words can tell!</p>
<p>&#8220;Young ladies, if your lives with us sent you out
into the world, first in accomplishments, thoroughly
grounded in the elements of an education, that after
all has only its beginning here, leaders in society,
and yet you wanted the nobility of that love which
the Bible claims is the fruit of the spirit, we should
have to say, we have &#8216;labored in vain, and spent our
strength for naught.&#8217; I wish I could see among you
that tenderness of spirit that would shrink as sensitively
from hurting another, as it does from being
hurt yourselves. I am looking anxiously for it in
this new year. I am looking hopefully for it; you
will not disappoint me I am sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Then she asked them to sing the hymn &#8220;Blest be
the tie that binds,&#8221; made a short prayer, and waited
before leaving the room for the hall to be cleared.
It was well she did; for no sooner had the last girl
left the corridor, before Kate Underwood came rushing
back to the platform, and catching hold of Miss
Ashton&#8217;s hand said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it, I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> do it, Miss Ashton, to
hurt Marion Parke&#8217;s feelings! I like her so much;
I think she is&mdash;is, why is about the best girl in the
whole school. I only meant&mdash;why I meant he was
such an old codger it was real funny; I thought it
would make a nice tableau, and I never thought
Marion would recognize it: I wouldn&#8217;t have done it
for the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she stopped, looked earnestly in Miss Ashton&#8217;s
face, and asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe me, Miss Ashton?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Miss Ashton knew Kate to be a very impulsive
girl, doing many foolish, and often wrong things,
only sometimes sorry for them, so she did not receive
her excited apologies with the consideration which
they really deserved.</p>
<p>She said, perhaps a little coldly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you have come to see the matter both
more kindly and reasonably, Kate. Yes! I do believe
you: I do not doubt you feel all you say; but, Kate,
you are so easily tempted by what seems to you fun.
I can&#8217;t make you see, fun that becomes personal in a
way to injure the feelings of any one ceases to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
fun, becomes cruelty. There is a great deal of that
in this school this term. Hardly a day passes but
some of the girls come to me crying because their
feelings have been wounded, and I am truly grieved
to say, you are oftener the cause of it than any other
girl. To be both witty and wise is a great gift; to
be witty without being wise is a great misfortune;
sometimes I think it has been your misfortune.
You are not a cruel girl. You are at bottom a kind
girl; yet see how you wound! You didn&#8217;t <i>mean</i> to
hurt Marion Parke; you like her, yet you did: you
made fun of an old country cousin, whose visit must
have been a trial to her. You are two Kates, one
thinks only of the fun and the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of a witty tableau;
the other would have done and said the
kindest and the prettiest things to make Marion
Parke happy. Which of these Kates do you like
best?&#8221; Miss Ashton now laid her hand lovingly over
the hands of the excited girl, who answered her with
her eyes swimming in tears, &#8220;Your kind, Miss
Ashton.&#8221; Then she put up her lips for the never-failing
kiss, and went quietly away, but not to her
own room.</p>
<p>There was something truly noble in the girl, after
all. She went to Marion&#8217;s door and, knocking gently,
asked if Marion would walk with her to the grove.</p>
<p>Much surprised, but pleased, Marion readily consented,
and the two went out in the early darkness
of an October night alone, the girls whom they met
in the corridors staring at them as they passed.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 357px;'>
Marion turned, threw both arms around Kate&#8217;s neck, kissing her over and over again.&mdash;Page 89.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Marion!&#8221; said Kate, &#8220;I ask your pardon a thousand,
million times! I never, <i>never</i> meant to hurt
your feelings! I forgot everything but the fun I saw
in the old farm-scenes, and the new fashionable
school-girl out for a vacation; I did truly. I&mdash;I
don&#8217;t say it would ever have occurred to me if that
cousin of yours hadn&#8217;t come here, because that
wouldn&#8217;t be true, and I&#8217;m as bad as George Washington&#8221;
(with a little laugh now), &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell a lie;
but can say that I never would have written one
word of that miserable farce if I had ever dreamed
it would have hurt your feelings: will you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion had listened to this long speech with varying
emotions. As we know, she had been wounded
by the tableaux, but her feelings had been exaggerated
by her room-mates, and if the matter had been
dropped at once she would probably soon have forgotten
it. Kate&#8217;s apology filled her with astonishment.
How could it ever have come to her knowledge
that she had been wounded, and how came she to
think it of enough importance to make an apology
now.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Marion turned, threw both
arms around Kate&#8217;s neck, kissing her over and over
again.</p>
<p>Kate, surprised in her turn, returned the kisses
with much ardor.</p>
<p>It was a girl&#8217;s forgiveness, and its recognition,
without another word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Then they walked down into the grove, their arms
around each other&#8217;s waists, and the belated birds,
scurrying to their nests, sang evening songs to them.</p>
<p>On the side of the little lake that nestles in the
midst of the grove, two petted frogs, grown large
and lazy on the sweet things with which their visitors
so freely regaled them, heard their steps, hopped
up a little nearer to the well-worn path, and saluted
them with an unusually loud bass.</p>
<p>Whether it was the influence of Miss Ashton&#8217;s
words, or the generous act of apology,&mdash;the noblest
showing of a noble mind that has erred,&mdash;it would be
hard to tell; but, certain it is, Kate Underwood had
learned a lesson this time which, let us hope, she
will never forget.</p>
<p>When Marion went back to her room it was quite
time for study hours to begin; but her room-mates
had so many questions to ask about Kate&#8217;s object
in inviting her out to walk, that a good half-hour
passed before they began their lessons.</p>
<p>Marion did not feel at liberty to repeat what Kate
had said, and so she frankly told them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>MISS ASHTON&#8217;S FRIDAY NIGHT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Ashton, a little timid from the use made of
the liberty she had given for the Friday night entertainments,
decided for a time to take the control
of them into her own hands, and as something
novel, that might be entertaining, she proposed that
the school should prepare original papers, to be read
aloud, the reading to be followed by &#8220;a spread&#8221;
given by the Faculty. She made no suggestion
with regard to the character of the papers to be
sent in, other than to say that she knew very well
there were some good writers in the school, and she
should expect every one to do her best.</p>
<p>This proposal was gladly accepted. The girls
clapped when she had finished, and some began to
stamp noisily, but this a motion of the principal&#8217;s
hand checked.</p>
<p>There began at once to be conjectures as to whose
piece would be the best. Nine-tenths of the girls
agreed it would be Kate Underwood, the other tenth
were for Delia Williams, who, when she tried for an
honor, seldom failed to secure it; and hadn&#8217;t she
once written a piece on Robert Browning, of which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
not a scholar could understand a word, but which, it
was reported, Miss Ashton said &#8220;was excellent, showing
rare appreciation of the merits of a great poet&#8221;?</p>
<p>One thing was certain, there was hardly a girl in
school who had not, before going to bed that night,
wandered around in her dazed thoughts for some
subject upon which she could write in a way that
would surprise every one.</p>
<p>Lilly White, the dunce of the school, had hers
written by the beginning of study hours. It covered
three pages of foolscap paper, and had at least the
merit of being written on only one side.</p>
<p>Among the few books Marion Parke had brought
from her Western home, was an old magazine, printed
by a Yale College club, and edited by her father
when he was a member of the college.</p>
<p>This had in it one short story suggested by the
West Rock at New Haven. In this rock was a rough
cave, and here, tradition said, the regicides Goff and
Whalley hid themselves from pursuit, after the murder
of Charles I. The story was well told, not holding
too rigorously to facts, but at the same time
faithful enough to real incidents to make it not only
interesting but valuable.</p>
<p>These were tender and touching scenes of a wife
and a betrothed, who, through dangers of discovery
and arrest, carried food and papers to the fugitives.</p>
<p>The story had always been a great favorite of
Marion&#8217;s. One day when she felt homesick she had
taken it out, read it, and left it on the top of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
table, under her Bible. Being very busy afterwards,
and consequently the homesickness gone, she did
not think of it again; she did not even notice that it
had been abstracted from the table and another
magazine, similar in appearance, put in its place.</p>
<p>If Miss Ashton had foreseen the deep interest the
school were taking in the proposed entertainment,
she might have hesitated to propose it. The truth
was, it took the first place; studies became of
secondary importance. &#8220;What subjects had been
chosen for the pieces? how they were to be treated?
how they progressed? how they would be received?&#8221;
These were the questions asked and answered, often
under promise of secrecy, sometimes with an open
bravado amusing to see.</p>
<p>It was a relief to all the teachers when the Friday
night came. The girls in gala dress crowded early
into the hall; Miss Ashton and the teachers, also in
full dress, followed them soon; and five minutes before
the time appointed for the opening of the evening
entertainment the hush of expectation made the
room almost painfully still.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton had requested that the pieces should
be sent in to her the previous day. She had been
surprised more at their number than their excellence,
indeed, there was but one that did not, on the whole,
disappoint her; that one delighted her.</p>
<p>She intended to read, not the best only, but the
poorest, thinking, perhaps, as good a lesson as could
come to the careless or the incapable would come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
from that sure touchstone of the value of any writing,&mdash;its
public reception.</p>
<p>The names were to be concealed; that had been
understood from the beginning, yet, with the exception
of Kate Underwood, who was more used to the
public of their small world than any of the others,
there was not a girl there who had not a touch of
stage fright, either on her own account, or on that
of her &#8220;dearest friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were essays on friendship, love, generosity,
jealousy, integrity, laziness, hope, charity, punctuality,
scholarship, meanness. On youth, old age,
marriage, courtship, engagement, housekeeping,
housework, the happiness of childhood, the sorrows
of childhood, truth, falsehood, religion, missionary
work, the poor, the duties of the rich, houses of
charity, the tariff, the Republican party, the Democratic
party, woman&#8217;s suffrage, which profession was
best adapted to a woman, servants, trades&#8217; unions,
strikes, sewing-women, shop-girls, newspaper boys,
street gamins, the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots,
Queen Victoria and the coming Republican party
into the government of England, the bloated aristocracy,
American girls as European brides, the
cruelty of the Russian government, Catholic religion,
Stanley as a hero, Kane&#8217;s Arctic adventures.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton had made a list of these subjects as
she looked over the essays, and when she read them
aloud, the school burst into a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;I cannot, in our limited time, read all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
of these to you. I will give you your choice, but
first, let me tell you what remains. There are six
poems of four and five pages length. The subjects
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lost Naiad; Bertram&#8217;s Lament; Cowper at
the Grave of His Mother; A New Thanatopsis; Ode
to Silence; Love&#8217;s Farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you shall have these,
if nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slight approbatory clapping, and she went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am to read you the titles of the stories I
have on my desk, it will go far into the alloted time
for these exercises; but, as some of you may think
they would be the most interesting part, I will give
you your choice. Those in favor, please hold up
their hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost every girl&#8217;s hand in school was raised, so
Miss Ashton went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Allen&#8217;s Resolve; The Old Moss Gatherer;
Lady Jane Grey&#8217;s Adventure; The Brave Engineer;
How We didn&#8217;t Ascend Mt. Blanc; Nancy Todd&#8217;s
Revenge; Little Lady Gabrielle; Sam the Boot-black;
Christmas Eve; Thanksgiving at Dunmoore;
New Year at Whitty Lodge; Poor Loo Grant;
Jenkins, the Mill Owner; Studyhard School; Storied
West Rock; Phil, the Hero; How Phebe Won Her
Place; Norman McGreggor on his Native Heath;
Our Parsonage; How Ben Fought a Prairie Fire;
The Sorrows of Mrs. McCarthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are all,&#8221; and Miss Ashton laughed a merry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
laugh as she turned over the pile. &#8220;I am much
obliged to you for your ready and full answer to my
proposal. If I am a little disappointed at the literary
character of some of the work, I am, as I have said,
pleased by your ready response. If I should attempt
to read them all, we should be here at a late hour,
and lose our spread, so I will give you the poems, as
I promised, and as many of the essays and stories as
I can crowd into the time previous to nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Bent, who was the teacher of elocution, now
stepped forward, and out of a pile separated from the
larger one of manuscripts took up and read the six
poems; then followed, in rapid succession, essays and
stories, until at ten minutes before nine, the school
having evidently heard all they wished with the spread
in prospect, Miss Ashton said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have reserved the best&mdash;by far the best&mdash;of
all these contributions for the last. Miss Bent will
now read to you &#8216;Storied West Rock!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Bent began immediately, and though the
hands of the clock crept on to fifteen minutes past
nine, not a girl there watched them; all were intent
on the absorbing interest of the story.</p>
<p>When it was finished, Miss Bent said, &#8220;This is so
excellent that I feel fully justified in departing from
the promise Miss Ashton made you, that your pieces
should not have the name of the writer given; with
her leave, it gives me great pleasure to say, this touching
and excellently written story was composed by
one of our own seniors, Susan Downer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Susan Downer!&#8221; cried Kate
Underwood, springing from her seat; and if ever
boys in any finishing school gave cheers with greater
gusto, they would have been well worth hearing.
Even Susan found herself cheering as noisily as the
rest, and would not have known it, if Dorothy, her
face radiant with delight, had not stopped her.</p>
<p>Then followed the spread, &#8220;the pleasantest and
the best one that was ever given in Montrose Academy,&#8221;
the girls all said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>STORIED WEST ROCK.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Marion Parke went back to her room the
night after Miss Ashton&#8217;s entertainment, she was in
a great deal of perturbation. The title of Susan
Downer&#8217;s story, on its announcement, had filled her
with surprise, for since her coming to the school she
had never before heard West Rock mentioned. When
she had asked about it, no one seemed even to have
known of it, and that Susan should not only have
heard, but been so interested as to choose it for the
subject of her story, was a puzzle! But when the
story was read, and she found it, in all its details, so
exactly like her father&#8217;s, her surprise changed to
a miserable suspicion, of which she was heartily
ashamed, but from which she could not escape.
Sentence after sentence, event after event, were so
familiar to her, nothing was changed but the names of
the women who figured in the story.</p>
<p>The first thing she did after coming to her room
was to take the magazine from under the Bible, and
open to the story. There was an ink-blot on the
first page, which some one had evidently been trying
to remove with the edge of a knife. It must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
been done hastily, for the leaf was jagged, and most
of the ink left on.</p>
<p>This Marion was sure was not there the last time
she had opened the magazine; some one had dropped
it recently. Who was it?</p>
<p>She hastily re-read the story. Yes, she had not
been mistaken, Susan Downer&#8217;s story was the
same!</p>
<p>Was it possible that two people, her father and
Susan, who had never been in New Haven, but
might have known about Goff and Whalley from her
study of English history, though not about West
Rock as her father had seen and described it, could
have happened upon the same story? How very,
very strange!</p>
<p>Marion dropped the magazine as if it was accountable
for her perplexity; then she sat and stared at
it, until she heard the door opening, when she
snatched it up, and hid it away at the bottom of her
trunk.</p>
<p>It was Dorothy who came into the room; and
Marion&#8217;s first impulse was to go to her and tell her
all about it, ask her what she should do, for do something
she felt sure she must.</p>
<p>Dorothy saw her, and called,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion! isn&#8217;t it splendid that Sue wrote such a
fine piece? I feel that she is a real honor to our
class and to Rock Cove! Her brother Jerry will be
so happy when he hears of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Marion!&#8221; catching sight of Marion&#8217;s pale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
face, &#8220;what is the matter with you? You look as
pale as a ghost. Are you sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o,&#8221; said Marion slowly. &#8220;O Dody! Dody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion! there is something the matter with you.
Sit down in this chair. No, lie down on the lounge.
No, on your bed. You&#8217;d better undress while I go
for the matron. I&#8217;ll be very quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Dody! Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; and Marion caught
tight hold of Dorothy&#8217;s arm, holding her fast. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not sick; I&#8217;m frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in spite of her words, indeed more alarmed by
them, Dorothy broke away and rushed down to the
matron&#8217;s room, who, fortunately, was out. Then she
went for Miss Ashton, but she also had not returned.
So Dorothy, unwilling to leave Marion alone any
longer, went back to her.</p>
<p>While she was gone, Marion had time to resolve
what she would do, at least for the present; she
would leave Susan in her own time and way to make
a full confession, which she tried to persuade herself
after a little that she would certainly do. So when
Dorothy came back she met her with a smile, told
her not to be troubled, that it was the first time in
her life such a thing had ever happened, and she
hoped it never would again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you were frightened,&#8221; insisted
Dorothy, &#8220;and you looked so pale; what frightened
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion hesitated; to tell any one, even Dorothy,
would be to accuse Susan of such a mean deception.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
No; her resolve so suddenly made was the proper
one: she would keep her knowledge of the thing until
Susan herself confessed, or assurance was made
doubly sure; for suppose, after all, Susan had written
the story, how could she have known about it in that
magazine? She had never lent it to her; she had
never read it to any of her room-mates, or to any
one in the school, proud of it as she was. Indeed,
the more she thought of it, the more sure she was
that she ought to be ashamed of herself for such a
suspicion, and, strange as it may seem, the more sure
she also was, that almost word by word Susan had
stolen the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was frightened at a thought I had, a dreadful
thought; I wouldn&#8217;t have any one know it. Don&#8217;t
ask me, Dody, please don&#8217;t; let us talk about something
else,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Then she began to talk rapidly over the events of
the evening, not, as Dorothy noticed, mentioning
Susan or her success. Dorothy wondered over it,
and an unpleasant thought came into her mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be that Marion is jealous of Sue, and
disappointed and vexed that her piece wasn&#8217;t taken
any more notice of? I&#8217;m sure it was an excellent
story, &#8216;How Ben Fought a Prairie Fire.&#8217;&#8221; Marion
had read it to her before handing it in, and she had
been much interested in it, but it didn&#8217;t compare with
Susan&#8217;s, and it wasn&#8217;t like Marion to feel so. She
never had shown such a spirit before.</p>
<p>Neither Susan nor Gladys came to their room until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the last moment allowed for remaining away. Susan
was overwhelmed with congratulations on her success.
The teacher of rhetoric told her she felt repaid for
all the hours she had spent in teaching her, by the
skill she had shown in this composition, and if she
continued to improve, she saw nothing to prevent
her taking her place, by and by, among the best
writers in the land. Kate Underwood pretended to
be vexed, &#8220;having her laurels taken away from her,&#8221;
she said &#8220;was not to be borne;&#8221; and Delia Williams,
the rival of Kate in the estimation of the school, made
even more fun than Kate over her own disappointment.
Some of the girls made a crown of bright
papers and would have put it on Susan&#8217;s head, but
she testily pushed it away.</p>
<p>Susan&#8217;s love of prominence was well known in the
school, and even this small rejection of popular
applause they wondered over.</p>
<p>And when the girls began to cluster around her,
and to ask if she had ever been to that West Rock,
if there was really such a place, and if all those things
she wrote of so beautifully had ever happened? she
was silent and sulky; and in the end, crowned with
her new honors, at the point in her life she had
always longed for, and never before reached, she
looked more like a girl who was ashamed of herself,
than like one whose vanity and love of praise had for
the first time been fully gratified.</p>
<p>She dreaded going to her room; she was afraid
something to mar her success was waiting for her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
there. She wished Marion Parke had never come
from the West, that Gladys had never been weak
enough to take her in for a room-mate. In short,
Susan was more unhappy than she had ever been
before. Gladys, full of frolic with a large clique
of girls in another part of the room, had not given her
a thought.</p>
<p>To have Susan write so good a story had been the
same surprise to her that it was to every one; but the
reading was no sooner over, than she had forgotten
it, and if the teacher had not told her it was time
she went to her room, she would also have forgotten
there was any room to go to.</p>
<p>When she saw Susan she said, &#8220;Come on if you
don&#8217;t want to get reported. I say, Sue, haven&#8217;t we
had a real jolly time?&#8221; but much to Susan&#8217;s relief
not a word about &#8220;Storied West Rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy had been waiting for Susan, and when
the gas was out and they were all in bed, she whispered
to her,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Sue! I&#8217;m so glad for you.&#8221; Dorothy thought
a moment after she heard a sound like a smothered
sob, but Susan not answering or moving, she concluded
she had fallen quickly asleep, and that was a
half snore; so she went to sleep herself, but not
without some troubled thoughts about Marion and
her unusual behavior.</p>
<p>When Marion and Susan met the next morning,
Marion noticed that Susan avoided her, never even
looked at her; and when Dorothy and Gladys went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
away to a recitation, leaving them alone, Susan hastily
gathered up her books, and going into her bedroom,
shut the door.</p>
<p>Marion thought this over. To her it looked as if
Susan felt guilty and was afraid; but she had determined
not to watch her, not even to seem to suspect
her. &#8220;How should she know that I remember the
story?&#8221; she thought, &#8220;or, indeed, that I have ever so
much as read it? I will put it off my mind; I will!
I <i>will!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in spite of her resolutions, Marion could not;
and as days went on she took to wondering whether
by thus concealing what she knew, she was not making
herself a partner in the deception.</p>
<p>Susan, not being at once accused by Marion, came
slowly but comfortably to the conclusion that she
had not even the vaguest suspicion that anything
was wrong; still, she sedulously avoided her, and
when Dorothy noticed and asked her about it,
answered crossly, &#8220;She never had liked that girl,
and she never should to the longest day of her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Marion certainly does not approve of Susan.
How unfortunate!&#8221; thought this kind Dorothy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>NOVEMBER SNOWSTORM.</h3>
</div>
<p>When November had fairly begun, the grove was
leafless; the boats taken out of the little lake and
stored carefully away, to await the return of birds
and leaves; the days grown short, dark, and cold; the
&#8220;constitutionals&#8221; matters of dire necessity, but not
in the least of pleasure; study assumed new interest,
and the worried teachers, relieved for a time of their
anxieties over half-learned lessons, began to enjoy
their arduous work, finding it really pleasant to teach
such bright girls.</p>
<p>The girl who made the best recitation was the
heroine of the hour, rules were observed more faithfully,
a tender spirit went with them into the morning
and evening devotions, Faculty meetings became
cheerful. This seemed to Miss Ashton one of the
most prosperous and successful fall terms she had
ever known; she congratulated herself constantly
on its benign influences, and often said, &#8220;I have
fewer black sheep in my flock than I have ever gathered
together before.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was one reason for this prosperity which
she fully realized. Thanksgiving was not far distant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
and on that happy New England festival, the school
had a holiday of three or four days.</p>
<p>It was a practice to send then to the parents or
guardians of the pupils an account of their progress
in their studies. The system of marking had not
been abandoned in the school; and many a lazy
scholar, whom neither intreaties nor scolding seemed
to touch, was alarmed at the record which she
was to carry home. Such a thing had been known
as girls refusing to leave the academy even for
Thanksgiving, rather than to face what they knew
awaited them with their disappointed parents.</p>
<p>But from whatever cause the change had come, it
was destined to have a severe shock before the festival
day came.</p>
<p>Montrose Academy had been purposely built
within a few miles of the old and famous school
for boys in Atherton. The reasons for this were,
the ease with which the best lecturers could be
obtained from there in many departments (a competent
man finding plenty of time to lecture in both
academies), and the general literary atmosphere which
a social acquaintance engendered.</p>
<p>Of course this social acquaintance was not without
its drawbacks, and it had been found necessary for
both principals to require written permits for the
visits which the boys were inclined to make upon
the girls at Montrose.</p>
<p>So far, during this term, the boys had been fully
occupied by their athletic games; but as the ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
became one series of frozen humps, hands grew
numb, and feet cold, the interest in them subsided;
and yet the love of misrule, so much stronger in a
boys&#8217; than in a girls&#8217; school, grew more active and
troublesome.</p>
<p>Jerry Downer, a brother of Susan Downer, was a
member of this famous school; and it soon became
known among a class of boys who studied the Montrose
catalogue more faithfully than they did their
Livy, that he had a sister there, that she was a lively
girl, not too strict in obeying rules, fond of fun, &#8220;up
to everything,&#8221; as they described her; so it not infrequently
happened that Jerry was invited by a set, with
whom at other times he had little to do, to ride over
with them to Montrose, he calling on his sister and
cousins, while they apparently were waiting for him.</p>
<p>In this way Jerry had been quite frequently there,
no objection being made by Miss Ashton, as a note
from her to the principal of Atherton Academy
brought back a flattering account of Jerry as a
scholar, and as a boy to be fully trusted.</p>
<p>Jerry had improved in every respect since he went
to Atherton. He was now a tall, broad-shouldered,
active, well-dressed young man, who rang the doorbell
of the majestic porch at the Montrose Academy
with that unconsciousness which is the perfection of
good manners, and which came to him from his simplicity,
and went in among the crowd of girls, neither
seeing nor thinking of any but those he had come to
visit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Susan, in her own selfish way, was proud of him,
so he was always sure of a reception that sent him
back to his studies ambitiously happy.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of November there fell upon
Massachusetts such a snowstorm as the rugged old
State never had known before. It piled itself a foot
deep on the level ground, heaped up on fence and
wall, covered the trees with ermine, until even the
tenderest twig had its soft garment; bent telegraph
poles as ruthlessly as if communication was the last
thing to be cared for, blotted telephoning out of
existence, delayed trains all over the north, turned
electric and horse cars into nuisances, filled the
streets and the railroad stations with impatient grumblers,
had only one single redeeming thing, the
beauty of its scenery, and a certain weird, uncanny
feeling it brought of being suddenly taken out of a
familiar world and dropped into one the like of
which was never even imagined before.</p>
<p>There was one part of the community, however,
that looked upon it with great favor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the jolliest of sleigh-rides!&#8221; said a
clique of Atherton boys. &#8220;Hurra for old Jerry
Downer! We&#8217;ll make him turn out this time!&#8221;</p>
<p>The roads between the two places were soon well
worn, and not two days after the astonished world
had waked to its surprise, Samuel Ray&#8217;s best sleigh
was hired, four extra sets of bells promised for the
four horses, and a thoroughly organized &#8220;spree&#8221;
was decided upon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>It was no use to ask Jerry to help them in any
thing contrary to the rules; but through him they
might convey to certain girls there the knowledge of
their coming, and their plans for the evening. They
would give Jerry a note to his sister; she would
hand it to Mamie Smythe; and, once in her possession,
the whole thing would take care of itself.</p>
<p>The bells were taken off from the horses and put
carefully away in the bottom of the sleigh before it
left the stable; the boys did not have it driven to the
dormitories, as it did when they had a licensed ride,
but met it at Wilbur&#8217;s Corner.</p>
<p>They had a ready reason for this, and for the
absence of the bells when Jerry noticed and inquired
about them. It would not do to give him the least
occasion to suspect them.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful night, with a bright moon making
the cold landscape clearer and colder. There wasn&#8217;t
a young heart in either of these two educational
towns that would not have leaped with joy over the
pleasure of a sleigh-ride then and there.</p>
<p>A very merry ride the boys had as soon as they
had cleared the thickly settled part of the town,
breaking out into college songs, glees, snatches of
wild music that the buoyant air caught up and
carried on over the long reaches of the ghost-like
road before them.</p>
<p>Jerry had a fine baritone voice, and he loved
music. How he led tune after tune was a marvel
and a delight. As they passed solitary farmhouses,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
where only a light shone from a back kitchen window,
the quiet people there would drop their work and
listen as the sleigh dashed by.</p>
<p>When the party reached Montrose, Jerry was told
that &#8220;while he was making his visit they would
drive on, and if they were not back in time he had
better go home by the train, as they knew he
would not like to be out late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And by the way,&#8221; said Tom Lucas, taking a
ticket out of his pocket, &#8220;here is a railroad ticket I
bought the other day; you&#8217;d better use it, old fellow.
I shall never want it&mdash;that is, if we are not back in
time for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys knew Jerry worked hard for every cent
he had, and Tom would have felt mean if he had let
a ride to which he had invited him be an expense.</p>
<p>The first thing he did when Susan came into the
room was to give her the note intrusted to him; and
Susan, understanding only too well what it meant,
delivered it without any delay to Mamie Smythe.</p>
<p>Jerry&#8217;s call was always a treat to his friends; and
to-night, Marion coming with them, he had an evening
the pleasure of which, in spite of what followed,
he did not soon forget.</p>
<p>When it came time for him to leave, he saw with
surprise that he could only by running catch his
train, and, as the boys had not come back for him, he
hurried away.</p>
<p>He found when he reached Atherton that the
study hour had already passed, and, going to his room,
he was met with,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Jerry; Uncle John don&#8217;t expect <i>you</i> to go
stealing off on sleigh-rides without leave. Give an
account of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The party had leave, and when that is given,
Uncle John don&#8217;t trouble himself to single out every
boy, and call him up to ask if he had his permission
to go. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in spite of this assertion, Jerry began to have
suspicions that, as the boys had failed to come for
him to return with them, it might, after all, be not
quite in order; and with these doubts he did not find
committing his lesson an easy task.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE SLEIGH-RIDE.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Susan hurried away from her brother to
find Mamie Smythe and give her the note, she knew
full well what it probably contained. Jerry had told
her he had come over with a party of boys, and had
the very best sleigh-ride he had ever had in his life;
and when she asked the names of his companions,
she recognized some, who, for reasons best known
to herself, Miss Ashton had forbidden to be received
as visitors to the academy. Mamie Smythe read the
note with a heightening color. This was it,&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Sleigh waiting corner of Bond and Centre Streets. Supper at
Bascoms&#8217; Hall engaged for a dance. Bring six lively girls! 8 <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>P.M</span>. sharp.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Sub Rosa</span>.&#8220;<br /></p>
<p>For a moment Mamie looked doubtingly into
Susan&#8217;s face. She would not have chosen her for
one of the &#8220;lively girls;&#8221; but, now, as Susan knew
something was going on, perhaps it would be best to
ask her, if&mdash;Mamie had conscience enough to dally
with this <i>if</i> for a moment; perhaps she might have
longer, if there had been time, but as it was now half-past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
seven, and the time was &#8220;eight sharp,&#8221; and the
girls were to be chosen and notified, there was not
a moment for parleying, even with so respectable a
thing as her conscience, so she showed Susan the
note.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! that&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; said Susan, as she
finished reading it. &#8220;Jerry is here, and he won&#8217;t go
away before eight. What can I do? it would be just
splendid!&#8221; And the tears actually came into her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pity!&#8221; and Mamie, more relieved than
sorry, tried to look regretful. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you tell.
Promise me, Susan Downer, let come what may, you
won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no tell-tale, Mamie Smythe, and I&#8217;ll thank
you not even to hint at such a thing. You&#8217;ll all get
expelled, as like as not, and, come to think of it, I&#8217;m
real glad I&#8217;m not to go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before her sentence was finished, Mamie had flown
out of the room, and wild with delight over the
&#8220;fun&#8221; before her, she rapidly made her choice
among the girls, not giving them time for consideration,
but hurrying them with all speed into their best
clothes. They crept out, one by one, through different
ways. Myra Peters jumped from a window
when she heard Miss Palmer&#8217;s door open, sure that
otherwise she would be found.</p>
<p>That her dress caught, that for a moment she
hung between the moonlit sky and a deep snow-bank,
seemed to her of no consequence, so she could escape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
She left a bit of her best dress hanging on a hook,
but this she did not know until afterwards.</p>
<p>The girls met in the street, near the large front
gate, where a tall Norway spruce hid them entirely
from the front windows of the academy. Certainly
they were not a merry group when they came together.
All they had to say to each other was in
hushed and frightened tones the peril of their
escape.</p>
<p>When they reached the corner of Bond and Centre
Streets there stood the sleigh! How tempting it
looked with its warm fur robes, its four gayly caparisoned
horses, its driver, slapping his hands together
to keep them warm, and the boys coming to meet
them with such a merry welcome!</p>
<p>Did they forget there was such a thing as consequences?
Who can tell?</p>
<p>We would not if we could describe any further the
occurrences of the evening. It was past twelve when
the six girls, tired, frightened, locked out of the house
by every door, found themselves&mdash;sleigh, horses,
bells, boys, all gone&mdash;shivering under the back balcony,
as forlorn a set of beings as the calm moon
shone upon.</p>
<p>It was not for some time that Myra Peters remembered
the window out of which she had clambered.
If that were unlocked here might be an entrance that
at this time of night would be wholly unobserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if it is?&#8221; asked the most frightened of the
girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Julia Abbey, you are always croaking,&#8221; scolded
shaking Mamie Smythe. &#8220;The next time I ask you
to go anywhere, I shall know it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hope you never will; it&mdash;it don&#8217;t pay,&#8221;
sobbed Julia.</p>
<p>One of the girls had tried the window, found it
still unlocked, and had partly raised it. Now the
question was, who would be the first one to go in?
It was Mamie Smythe who felt the responsibility of
the ride, and therefore the necessity of putting
on a brave face, and taking whatever consequences
followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, girls,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some of you lift me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mamie was small and light; it was not a difficult
thing to do, as she clung to the window-sill, and in a
moment she had disappeared. Then her head came
out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, girls,&#8221; she said in a whisper. &#8220;Come
quickly, and as soon as you are in go softly right to
your rooms. It&#8217;s still as a mouse here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there was a pushing among the girls, not who
should venture as before, but who might go. They
were too cold and alarmed not to be selfish, and
their struggle for precedence delayed them, until
Mamie impatiently called the one to come by name.</p>
<p>In this way, one after another safely entered, crept
to their rooms unheard and unseen, leaving the tell-tale
bit of dress hanging on the hook, and forgetting
to fasten the window behind them.</p>
<p>If they had been all together in one corridor, their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
pale faces and poor recitations might, at least, have
excited the teachers&#8217; suspicion that something was
wrong; but, as it was, it only seemed to be an event
of not very uncommon occurrence that some one
should come into the class poorly prepared.</p>
<p>It now wanted ten days of Thanksgiving. Only
a few of the pupils,&mdash;those who had come from
Mexico, Texas, Oregon, San Francisco, and other
distant places,&mdash;but had all their plans made for
spending the festival at home; and these, with one
exception, were invited away. The school was on
the tiptoe of expectation, when, one morning after
prayers, Miss Ashton sent for Susan Downer to
come to her room.</p>
<p>This was the first time such a thing had happened
to Susan, and if she had been an innocent girl she
would have been elated by it; but, alas, we well know
that she was not, so it was with much trepidation
that she answered the summons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan,&#8221; said Miss Ashton kindly, &#8220;I am in a
good deal of trouble; I thought you might help me.
How long is it since your brother came to see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>What a relief to Susan! Miss Ashton had often
inquired about Jerry, and once came into the room
to see him, so she answered glibly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Week before last, on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He came in the evening, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am: it was a beautiful moonlight night,
and a party of boys that were taking a sleigh-ride
brought him over.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did he go back with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Susan unhesitatingly. Jerry
had not told her of his possible return in the cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your brother know many of the young
ladies here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows his cousins, of course, and Marion
Parke, and some of the girls that happened to come
into the parlor when he was here, to whom I
introduced him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me the names of the girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan hesitated a moment. What could Miss
Ashton want to know for? What could Jerry have
done to make her suspect him?</p>
<p>All at once the thought of the sleigh-ride flashed
upon her, and she colored violently. He had brought
the note for Mamie Smythe. The girls had gone on
the sleigh-ride. She had heard the whole story
from them on their return.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton watched the color come and go; then
she said quietly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The names of the girls to whom you have
introduced him, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it so happened that these girls were not
among the sleighing-party, and after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation Susan named them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Miss Ashton said pleasantly. &#8220;That
is all now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All now, <i>now</i>,&#8221; repeated Susan to herself, as she
went back to her room. &#8220;Is there anything more
to come by and by I wonder?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>Miss Drake, Susan&#8217;s teacher in logic, found her a
very absent-minded pupil during the next recitation,
and gave her the lowest mark for the poorest lesson
of the term.</p>
<p>In truth, the more Susan thought the matter over,
the more troubled she became. Miss Ashton never
would have asked those questions without a particular
purpose. That she had no suspicions about
&#8220;Storied West Rock&#8221; was plain, for not a question
tended that way, but all toward the sleigh-ride; for
the first time since it had taken place Susan felt glad
that she had not gone.</p>
<p>She attached little importance to the giving of the
note to Mamie Smythe. How was she to know its
contents? She was not in the habit of opening
other people&#8217;s notes. To be sure, her conscience
told her, she did know them, and, besides, that
troublesome old adage would keep coming back to
her, &#8220;The partaker is as bad as the thief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should Miss Ashton put the question point-blank
to her, &#8220;Susan Downer, did, or did you not, know of
the sleigh-ride?&#8221; What should she answer? To
say she did, would be to bring not only herself, but
all the other girls into trouble, perhaps to be the
means of their being expelled.</p>
<p>To say she knew nothing about it would be to tell
a <i>lie</i>. Susan dealt plainly enough with herself now,
not even to cover it with the more respectable name
of falsehood, and it was so hard to escape Miss
Ashton if she were once on the track; she <i>would</i> find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
out, and if she did not expel her too, she would never
respect her again.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged, Susan&#8217;s was a hard
place; but she is not the first, and will by no means
be the last, to learn that the way of the transgressor
is often very, very hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; was Susan&#8217;s conclusion, after some
hours of painful thought. &#8220;Thanksgiving is most
here, and she&#8217;ll forget it before we come back.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>DETECTIVES AT WORK.</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Ashton&#8217;s forgetfulness was not of a kind to
be depended upon. Mr. Stanton, the janitor, had come
to her a few days after the sleigh-ride to tell her that
he had found a back window unlocked; that he was
sure he had locked it carefully before going to bed,
and that under the window was the print of footsteps.</p>
<p>He &#8220;kind o&#8217; hated,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to be a-telling on
the gals, but then, agin, he hadn&#8217;t been there nigh
eighteen years without learning that gals were gals,
as well as boys were boys, and weren&#8217;t allers&mdash;not
zactly allers&mdash;doin&#8217; jist right; perhaps it was best
to let Miss Ashton know, and then&mdash;there now&mdash;he
hated to do it awfully. If the gals found it out it
might set &#8217;em agin him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Stanton,&#8221; said Miss Ashton gravely, &#8220;if you
had made this discovery and kept it to yourself, you
would have lost your place in twenty-four hours.
Please show me the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>The snow, for a wonder, remained as it was on the
night of the ride, and looking from the window Miss
Ashton saw the distinct marks of a number of feet
around the bank into which Myra Peters had fallen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
She also saw, and took off, the piece torn from her
dress. This would surely give her a clew to one of
the girls; but, before using it, she would make herself
acquainted as far as possible with the time and
circumstances when it had occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton could fix the morning when he found
the window unlocked, and Miss Ashton remembered
that on the previous evening Susan Downer&#8217;s brother
had been there to call.</p>
<p>This put a really serious aspect upon the matter.
She immediately connected it with the boys from the
Atherton Academy. She called a Faculty meeting,
hoping some of the teachers had heard the girls go
and come, or the sleigh, if indeed it had been a
sleigh-ride that tempted them.</p>
<p>But none of them had heard the least noise after
bedtime, nor even unusual sleigh-bells. If it had
not been for the open window, the footprints, and the
torn bit of dress, Miss Palmer, who prided herself
upon, and made herself unpopular by, her vigilance,
would have said it could not have happened; as it
was, there was no denying it, and no question that
something must be done.</p>
<p>Susan Downer&#8217;s examination had proved so far
satisfactory to Miss Ashton, that it had shown her
there had been a sleigh-ride given by the Atherton
boys; and she said reluctantly to herself, &#8220;I am
afraid the reliable-looking young man, Jerry Downer,
had a hand in it. How strange it is that we can
trust young people so little!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Then Miss Ashton felt ashamed of this feeling;
for in her long experience she had known a great
many true as gold, who had gone out from her training
to be burning and shining lights in the world.</p>
<p>The quickest way to get at the bottom of the
whole, she thought after much deliberation, would
be to take the bit of torn dress into the hall, and ask
to which young lady it belonged.</p>
<p>Accordingly, after morning prayers, she asked the
school to stop a few moments, held the piece of cloth
up in her hand, and simply said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The owner of it might need it for repairing her
dress, and if she would remain after the others left, it
would be at her disposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of the school laughed and chatted
merrily about it. Some few came up to see if it
could have by any luck belonged to the torn dresses
of which not a few hung in their closets.</p>
<p>But no one claimed it! Here, then, was a dilemma!
It would not be possible to go to every
room, and examine the wardrobe of every scholar;
besides, now it was known that the bit had been
found, and might easily be made to lead to a discovery
of the guilty ones, what more natural than that
the dress should be hidden away, or sent from the
academy building to prevent the possibility of detection!</p>
<p>Miss Ashton was disappointed over this failure.
She was not much of a detective, and had less reason
for being so than falls to the lot of many teachers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>She wrote to the principal of the Atherton Academy,
inquiring whether he had given leave to a
party of his boys to take a sleigh-ride on the night
of the twentieth of November. She knew Jerry
Downer had been one of them, as he had called on
his sister, who was one of her pupils, on that night.</p>
<p>She received an immediate answer, saying, &#8220;He
had not given leave for any sleigh-ride on that night,
and was both surprised and sorry that a boy he had
always considered so reliable as Jerry Downer should
have been among them. He would inquire into the
matter at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he lost no time; sending for Jerry, he put
the question point-blank, his usual straightforward
way of dealing with his boys,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you go on a sleigh-ride the evening of the
twentieth of November?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Jerry unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I give you leave to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; but I supposed the party had asked you,
or they would not have gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your supposition was entirely erroneous. My
leave had never been asked. Who besides yourself
made up the party?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Jerry hesitated: he could take the blame of
his own going, but it would be mean in him to tell
the names of his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr.&mdash;Uncle John (the principal smiled grimly as
he heard this familiar name), I mean Dr. Arkwright,&#8221;
said Jerry, the color browning, instead of reddening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
his sea-tanned face, &#8220;I am very sorry, sir; I thought
they had leave; I would not have gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>think</i> again; <i>know</i>, Jerry Downer: that is
the only way for a boy that wants to do right. You
will tell me, if you please, the names of your companions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that be honorable in me, sir?&#8221; asked
Jerry, now looking the doctor straight in the eye.</p>
<p>A look of doubt passed over the principal&#8217;s face
before he answered, then he said with less austerity,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must find out in some way who among my boys
have broken my rules; you can help me more directly
than any one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be honorable in me?&#8221; repeated Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not here to ask questions, but to answer
them. Are you going to refuse to help me by giving
me the names of the boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot, indeed I cannot; it would be so mean
in me. You must punish me any way I deserve, sir;
I am willing to bear it; but I cannot tell on the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Jerry Downer; you are dismissed,&#8221;
and he waved Jerry out of the room.</p>
<p>But after Jerry had gone, he went to the window
and stood watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a generous boy!&#8221; he said; &#8220;but he has
made a mistake. He will see it when he is older and
wiser. He will learn that true manhood helps law
and order, not even the idea of honor coming before
it, noble as it is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Still the difficulty of unravelling the matter remained
with him in as much doubt as it did with
Miss Ashton; but with both of these excellent principals
there was no question but that it must be sifted
to the bottom, the delinquents discovered and punished.</p>
<p>The time for doing this was short; and should it
be necessary to expel a pupil, the coming vacation
offered a suitable occasion.</p>
<p>Soon after, Miss Ashton, going through the corridor
one evening, found two girls in close and excited
conversation,&mdash;Myra Peters and Julia Dorr.</p>
<p>They did not see her at first, so she was quite
near enough to them to catch a few words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may say what you please,&#8221; said Julia Dorr.
&#8220;I&#8217;m as sure of it as sure can be; I&#8217;ve sat close by you
time and again when you had it on, and if I had
been you I would have owned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Owned it!&#8221; snarled Myra Peters, &#8220;will you be
kind enough to mind your own business, and let
other people&#8217;s alone, Miss Interferer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, interferer or not, I&#8217;ve half a mind to go and
tell Miss Ashton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Miss Ashton what?&#8221; asked a voice close
beside them.</p>
<p>The girls turned, to find Miss Ashton there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Miss Ashton what?&#8221; she asked again
pleasantly; &#8220;I always like to hear good news.
What is this about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, nothing had really been farther from Julia&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
intention than to tell on Myra. She was one of
those who had gone up to the desk when Miss Ashton
showed the piece of cloth, and had recognized it
as like a dress she had seen Myra wear. That there
was anything of more importance attached to it than
the ability to mend the dress neatly, she did not
think, so she answered readily,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Ashton, that piece of cloth you showed
us was exactly like Myra&#8217;s dress. I&#8217;ve seen it a
hundred times; but she declares she never had a
dress like it, and we were quarrelling about it. I
wish you would show it to her close up, and see if
she don&#8217;t have to give in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will; come to my room, Myra!&#8221; and she led the
way there, Myra following with a frightened, sullen
face.</p>
<p>Then she found the piece, and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myra,&#8221; she said, after looking at the girl kindly
for a moment, &#8220;is this like your dress? Tell me
truly; it is much the best thing for you to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myra gazed at the cloth for a moment, then burst
into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you were one of the sleighing-party?&#8221; said
Miss Ashton quietly. &#8220;Will you tell me who were
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>If Myra had not been taken so entirely by surprise,
she might, probably would, have refused to answer,
for honor is as dear to girls as to boys; but she
sobbed out one name after another, until the six
stood confessed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; was all Miss Ashton said, then she
handed Myra the tell-tale cloth, and added, &#8220;You had
better put it neatly in the place from which it was
torn.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her door, and Myra, wiping her eyes,
went quickly out and back to her room.</p>
<p>Hardly conscious what she was doing, with an
impatient desire to get away, she began to pack her
trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go home, home, home!&#8221; she kept repeating
to herself. &#8220;I never will see one of those girls
again. Oh, dear, dear! If I only hadn&#8217;t gone on that
sleigh-ride; that abominable Mamie Smythe is always
getting the girls in trouble: I perfectly detest her.
What will my father say?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>REPENTANCE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It is a common error that to send a girl into a
boarding-school to finish her education is to bring
her out a model, not only in learning, but in accomplishments
and character.</p>
<p>Here were two hundred girls, coming from nearly
two hundred different families, each one brought up,
until she was in her teens, in different ways. Looking
over the population of a small village, the most
careless observer must see how unlike the homes are;
how every grade of morals and manners is represented,
and with what telling effect they show themselves
in the characters of the young trained under
their roofs.</p>
<p>It happened often that Montrose Academy was
looked upon by anxious parents&mdash;who were just discovering,
in wilfulness, disobedience, perhaps in matters
more serious even than these, the mistakes they had
made in the education of their daughters&mdash;as a sort of
reformatory school, where Miss Ashton took in the
erring, and after one or more years sent them out
perfect in every good work and way.</p>
<p>While Miss Ashton made all inquiries in her power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
to prevent any undesirable girls from joining her
school, she was often imposed upon, sometimes by
concealments, and not unseldom by positive falsehoods,
but oftener by the parental fondness which
could see nothing but good in a spoilt, darling child.</p>
<p>It often happened that with just such characters
Miss Ashton was very successful, not seldom receiving
a girl of a really fine nature which had been distorted
by home influences, and sending her away,
after years of patient work, with this nature so fully
developed and improved that her whole family rose to
her standard.</p>
<p>Instances of this kind made Miss Ashton careful
in her discipline. She well understood that a girl
once expelled from a school, no matter how lightly
her friends might appear to regard the occurrence,
was under a ban, which time and circumstances might
remove, but might not.</p>
<p>In the case of this sleigh-ride, the disobedience to
known and strictly enforced rules made her more
anxiety than any case of a similar kind had given
her for years.</p>
<p>She knew now the names of the girls concerned:
they had given her trouble before. Mamie Smythe
she had often been on the point of sending home, but
she was one of those characters with fine traits, capable
of being very good or very bad in her life&#8217;s work.
The mother was a wealthy widow, Mamie her only
child. Spoiled by weak and foolish fondness she
had been; but her brightness, her lovableness, her
cheery, witty, sunshiny ways remained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>Evidently, here she was the accountable one; she
should be expelled as a lesson to the school, but to
expel her meant, <i>what</i>?</p>
<p>She had wealth, she had position, she would in a
few years be able to wield an influence that, in the
right direction, would outweigh that of almost any
other girl in school.</p>
<p>To be sent home, back to that weak mother, with
a life of frivolous pleasures before her, what, under
these circumstances, was it the wisest and best thing
to do?</p>
<p>Favoritism for the rich or the poor was not one of
Miss Ashton&#8217;s faults. By this time the whole school
knew of the ride, of its discovery, and was holding its
breath over the probable consequences.</p>
<p>The girls said, &#8220;Miss Ashton grew thin and pale
from the worry.&#8221; The feeling of the school, most of
whom were tenderly attached to her, was decidedly
against those who had troubled her; and if she could
have known the true state of the case, when she was
neither eating nor sleeping, in her anxiety to do what
was right, she would have found that the good for
order, discipline, and propriety, which was growing
from this evil done, was to exceed any influence she
could hope to exert, even from the severest act of just
discipline.</p>
<p>She was to be helped in a most unexpected way.</p>
<p>Two days after her interview with Myra Peters,
there was a soft tap on her door, and opening it, there
stood Mamie Smythe!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Her face, usually covered with smiles, was grave
and even sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ashton,&#8221; she said, without waiting to close
the door, &#8220;please don&#8217;t be hard on the other girls.
It was all my fault; I was the Eve that tempted
them. I know it was wrong; I know it was <i>dreadful</i>
wrong! I was worse than Eve; I was the serpent
that tempted Eve! They wouldn&#8217;t a single one of
them have gone if it hadn&#8217;t been for me! Do,
please, Miss Ashton, punish me, and not them!
They never, never, <i>never</i> would have gone if I hadn&#8217;t
tempted them. Please, please, Miss Ashton! I&#8217;ll
do anything; I&#8217;ll get extra lessons for a year! I
won&#8217;t have a single spread; I&#8217;ll be good; you won&#8217;t
know me, Miss Ashton, I&#8217;ll be so good; and I&#8217;ll bear
any punishment. You may ferule me, as they do in
district schools,&#8221; and she held out a little diamond-ringed
hand toward Miss Ashton; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be shut up
for a week in a dark closet, and live on bread and
water. You may do anything you please with me,
only spare them,&#8221; and she looked so earnestly and
imploringly up in Miss Ashton&#8217;s face, that her heart,
in spite of her better judgment, was touched; all she
said was,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it, Mamie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Susan gave me the note,&#8221; began Mamie.
Miss Ashton started. &#8220;Susan who?&#8221; she asked, for
Susan Downer had not confessed to any note; indeed,
had virtually denied connection with the ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan Downer, of course; she gave me the note.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Her brother brought it to her, and I was wild with
joy to have a sleigh-ride. It was such a bright moon,
and the sleighing looked so fine, I wanted all day to
ask you to let me have a big sleigh, and take the girls
out, but I knew you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I should have,&#8221; interrupted Miss Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just awful,&#8221; said Mamie, after a moment&#8217;s
reflection; &#8220;and if I&#8217;d been brave enough to ask you,
nothing of this would have happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t time to think only of the girls&mdash;you
know them all, Miss Ashton!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who were the boys?&#8221; asked Miss Ashton,
thinking perhaps she might aid the other troubled
principal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys! oh, the boys!&#8221; and Mamie&#8217;s face
looked truly distressed now. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t ask me,
Miss Ashton. I&#8217;d cut my tongue out before I&#8217;d tell
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, go on with your ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mamie repeated fully and truly all that a girl
in the flush of excitement caused by a stolen sleigh-ride
could be expected to remember, not palliating
one thing, from the supper to the dance, and the
clamber in at midnight through the open window.</p>
<p>If at some points a little laugh gurgled up from
her fun-loving soul, as she told her tale, Miss Ashton
understood, and forgave it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, Mamie,&#8221; said she at last; and she
stroked the little hand given to her so loyally for the
sacrificial feruling, but she turned her eyes away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
What Mamie might have read there, she dared not
trust to the girl&#8217;s quick sight; indeed, she hardly
dared to trust the feeling that prompted it in herself.</p>
<p>There was no use to have another Faculty meeting,
and depend upon it for help; she must settle the
trouble alone.</p>
<p>It was Susan Downer who was next called to the
principal&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>She went tremblingly. What was to happen to
her now? Miss Ashton knew the girls&#8217; names who
went on the sleigh-ride, and as yet no one had been
punished. Could it be about &#8220;Storied West Rock&#8221;?
How Susan by this time hated its very name, and
how much she would have given if she had never
known it, she could best have told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan,&#8221; said Miss Ashton, as with a pale face
and downcast eyes the girl stood before her, &#8220;when
I asked you about your brother&#8217;s visit to you on the
night of the sleigh-ride, you did not tell me of the
note he gave you, and you gave to Mamie Smythe.
If you had, you would have saved me many troubled
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not ask me,&#8221; said Susan promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;True. Did you know the contents of the note?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamie asked me to go with them, but I refused.
I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t like it, and I&#8217;d much rather
lose a ride any time than displease you;&#8221; and Susan,
as she said this, looked bravely in Miss Ashton&#8217;s
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; the principal said gravely, and Susan,
with a lighter heart than that with which she had entered,
left the room; but Miss Ashton thought, as she
watched the forced smile on the girl&#8217;s face, &#8220;There&#8217;s
one that can&#8217;t be trusted; what a pity, for she is not
without ability!&#8221; Then she remembered the story
she had read and praised, and wondered over it.</p>
<p>Two days before the time for the term to close,
Miss Ashton received this note:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Our dear Miss Ashton</span>,&mdash;We, the undersigned, do regret in
sackcloth and ashes our serious misconduct in going away at an improper
time, and in an improper manner, on a sleigh-ride, without
your consent and approval.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>We promise, if you will forgive us, and restore us to your trust and
affection, that we will never, NEVER be guilty of such a misdemeanor
again. That we will try our best faithfully to observe the rules of
the school, and endeavor to be good and faithful scholars.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>Pray forgive and test us!</p>
<p style='margin-left:13.5em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:left'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mamie Smythe, Helen Norris,<br />
Jane Somers,  Julia Abbey,<br />
Myra Peters,  Etta Spring.</span><br /></p>
<p>Miss Ashton smiled as she read the note. Repentance
by the wholesale she had never found very reliable;
and in this instance she would have had much
more confidence if the girls had come to her, and made
a full confession, without waiting to be found out.</p>
<p>It was not until after two sleepless nights that she
came to the conclusion to give them further trial; and
when she called them to her room, one by one, and
had a long and faithful talk with them, sending them
from her tenderly penitent, she felt sure her course
had been a right one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>Then she made a short speech to the school, went
over briefly what had happened, not in the least sparing
the impropriety of the stolen ride, but, on account
of the repentance and promises from the girls concerned,
she had decided not to expel them now, but
to give them a chance to redeem the character they
had lost. The school clapped her enthusiastically as
she closed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>ACCEPTING A THANKSGIVING INVITATION.</h3>
</div>
<p>A week before Thanksgiving, Marion Parke
received this note from her Aunt Betty:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Niece</span>,&mdash;If you haven&#8217;t anywhere else to go, and have
money to come with, you can take the cars from Boston up here and
spend Thanksgiving Day with us at Belden. Your pa used to think
a lot of coming here when he went to college&mdash;the great pity he ever
went. He might have been well-to-do if he had stuck to farming, but
he always hankered after an eddication, and he got it, and nothin&#8217; else.
Your Cousin Abijah will drive over in his cutter and bring you here.
Don&#8217;t have nothing to do with Isaac Bumps; he&#8217;ll charge you twenty-five
cents, and tell you it&#8217;s a mile and a half from the station to my
house, but it&#8217;s only a mile, and don&#8217;t you hear to him, for your Cousin
Abijah can&#8217;t come until after the milking, and if the cows are fractious,
it may make him belated.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 6.25em;'>I am your great-aunt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 2.0em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Betsy Parke</span>.</span><br /></p>
<p>Marion had previously received a letter from her
father, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;If you have an invitation from your Aunt Betty to spend Thanksgiving
with her in Belden, by all means accept it. I want you to see
the town in which I was born; there is not a mountain or a valley
there that does not often cover these flat prairie-lands with their
remembered beauty. As they were a part of my boyish life, so are
they a part of my man&#8217;s; and when you come home we can talk of
them together. I was not born in the old farmhouse where your aunt
now lives, but my father was, and his father, and his father&#8217;s father,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
and your Aunt Betty was a kind, loving sister to your grandfather
long years ago.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Go, and write me all about the old home, all about the old aunt,
and make her forget, if you can, that I would not be a farmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the coming of this letter, Marion had many
invitations from her schoolmates to spend Thanksgiving
with them at their homes. Her room-mates
were very urgent that she should go to Rock Cove;
and besides her longing to see that wonderful mysterious
thing, the ocean, she had learned so much of
their homes during the weeks they had been together,
that she almost felt as if she knew all the friends
there, and would be sure of a welcome.</p>
<p>But her father&#8217;s letter left her no choice, and a
few cordial lines of acceptance went from her to her
Aunt Betty by the next mail. Of this decision
Miss Ashton heartily approved.</p>
<p>And now began in the school the pleasant bustle
which precedes this holiday vacation. Recitations
were gone through by the hardest. Meals were
eaten in indigestible haste; devotional exercises
were filled with &#8220;wandering thoughts and worldly
affections.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the long corridors and out from the
open doors came crowded, eager words of inquiry
and consultation. One would have thought who
heard them, that these girls had been close prisoners,
breaking away from a hard, dull life, instead of
what most of them really were, happy girls bound
for a frolic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Miss Ashton heard it all without the least injury
to her feelings. She had heard it for years, and, in
truth, was as glad of her vacation as any of her
girls.</p>
<p>A journey alone in a new country, with the beauty
of the autumn all gone, and the rigors of a New
England winter already beginning to show themselves,
made Marion, self-reliant as she usually was,
not a little timid as she saw the tall academy building
lost behind the hills, between which the cars
were bearing her on to New Hampshire. A homesick
feeling took possession of her, and a dread that
she might find Kate Underwood&#8217;s tableaux a reality
when she should reach her old aunt in the mountain-girded
farmhouse.</p>
<p>Three hours&#8217; ride through a bare and uninteresting
country brought her to Belden.</p>
<p>The day was extremely cold here. The snow,
which had seemed to her very deep at Montrose, lay
piled up in huge drifts, not a fence nor a shrub to be
seen. All around were spurs of the White Mountains,
white, literally, as she looked up to them, from
their base to their summit. There were great brown
trees clinging stiff and frozen to their steep sides;
sharp-pointed rocks, raising their great heads here
and there from among the trees.</p>
<p>Majestic, awful, solemn they looked to this prairie
child, as she stood on the cold platform of the little
station gazing up at them.</p>
<p>A voice said behind her, startling her,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come in, marm. It&#8217;s what we call
a terrible cold day for Thanksgiving week. Come
in, and warm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion turned, to see a man in a buffalo overcoat,
with whiskers the same color as the fur, eyes that
looked the same, a big red nose, a buffalo fur cap
pulled well down over his ears, with mittens to
match.</p>
<p>He stood in an open door, to which he gave a
little push, as if to emphasize his invitation.</p>
<p>Inside the ladies&#8217; room of the station a red-hot
stove sent out a cheerful welcome. To this the man
added stick after stick of dry pine wood, much to
Marion&#8217;s amusement and comfort, as she watched
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come from down South?&#8221; he asked, after he had
convinced himself of the impossibility of crowding
in another.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the West,&#8221; said Marion pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so. You ain&#8217;t Aunt Betty Parke&#8217;s
niece, now, be ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Marion Parke. Did you know my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see. Was your father Philip Parke?
Phil, we used to call him when he was a boy,
the one that would have an eddication, and went
a home-missionarying after he got chock-full of
books. Aunt Betty, she took it hard. Be he your
father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Marion, laughing; &#8220;he is my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so, wull, naow, I&#8217;m beat. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
don&#8217;t favor him not a mite; you sarten don&#8217;t. An&#8217;
you&#8217;re here to get an eddication too, be ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s what I hope to do. I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s so
cold here; I should like to walk to my aunt&#8217;s if it
were not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man gave a chuckle, which Marion did not at
all understand, jammed the stove full of wood again,
and remarked as he crowded in the last knot,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your Cousin Abijah; I know his old cowbells
a mile off! Better get warm!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion was hovering close over the stove when
the door opened and Cousin Abijah entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you be,&#8221; he called out hilariously as he
saw her. &#8220;Not froze nuther! You&#8217;re clear grit!
I told your Aunt Betty so, and she said &#8216;seein&#8217;
was believin&#8217;.&#8217; As soon as I&#8217;ve thawed my hands
a mite, we&#8217;ll be joggin&#8217;. Dan, that&#8217;s the hoss,
isn&#8217;t the safest to drive in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>The early twilight was already dropping down
over the hills before &#8220;the mite of thawing&#8221; was
done, and then wrapped up in an old blanket shawl
Aunt Betty had sent, and covered by two well-worn
buffaloes, they started.</p>
<p>What a ride it was! Marion will never forget how
Dan crawled along up a mountain road, where the
path ran between huge snow-drifts, under beetling
rocks that looked as if an avalanche might at any
moment fall from them and crush horse and riders
in the sleigh. Sometimes going under arches of old
pine-trees, the arms of which had met and interlocked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
long, long years ago; up steep declivities, where the
horse seemed almost over their heads, down steep
declivities, where they seemed over the horse&#8217;s head,
never meeting any one, only hearing the dull moaning
of the wind among the forest trees, and the
louder moaning of old Dan, as he toiled painfully
along.</p>
<p>At last there came an opening that widened until
they crossed the mountain spur, and the little village
of Belden lay before them.</p>
<p>Marion saw a church steeple, a few houses, a sawmill,
and great spaces covered with snow. To one
of these houses, on the outskirts of the village,
Cousin Abijah drove. The house was a two-storied
old farmhouse, innocent of paint or blind. There
was not a fence round, or a tree near it. On one
side was a wooden well-top, with a long arm holding
an iron-bound bucket above it, the arm swinging
from a huge beam, from which, in its turn, swung
two large stones, suspended from the well-sweep by
an iron chain. A well-worn foot-path came from
a back door to it, and on this path stood a yellow
dog, nose in air, and tail beating time on a snow-bank.</p>
<p>It was the only living thing to be seen, and Marion&#8217;s
heart sank within her. She was cold, tired,
and homesick; and she saw at once that around the
small front door, before which Cousin Abijah in
his gallantry had stopped, no footstep had left a
mark. The snow-bank reached to the handle, clung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
to it, and as absolutely refused entrance, as did a
shrill voice which at once made itself heard, but
from whence Marion could not conjecture. It said,
however, &#8220;Go round to the back door! What&#8217;s good
enough for me, is good enough for them that come
to see me!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>AUNT BETTY&#8217;S RECEPTION OF HER GUEST.</h3>
</div>
<p>When the sleigh stopped before the back door, it
was slowly opened, and Marion saw a tall, lank old
woman with thin gray hair, small, faded blue eyes, a
long, sharp nose, and thin lips, standing in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I see you well,&#8221; said a not unkindly voice,
and something like a smile played over the hard old
face. A knotty hand was held out toward her, and
when she put hers timidly within it, it drew her
into a large kitchen, where a cooking-stove, that
shone like a mirror, sent out rays of heat even to the
open door.</p>
<p>It was like Kate Underwood&#8217;s &#8220;Tableau kitchen,&#8221;
yet how different! It had such an air of cleanliness
and comfort, that everything, even to the old chairs
and tables, the long rows of bright pewter that
adorned a swinging shelf, the hams clothed in spotless
bags, hanging from the old crane in the big
chimney, all had a certain air of refinement which
went at once to Marion&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty took off one of the lids of the stove,
jammed in all the wood it could be made to hold,
then moved a straw-bottomed chair, laced and interlaced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
with twine to keep the broken straw in place,
close to the stove, and motioned Marion to sit down
in it.</p>
<p>Then she stood at a little distance looking at her
curiously. &#8220;You don&#8217;t favor the Parkes,&#8221; she said,
after a slow examination. &#8220;You look more like
your Aunt Jerushy; she was on my mother&#8217;s side.
Your brown hair is hern, and your gray eyes; you
feature her too. When you&#8217;re warm through, you
can go up-stairs and lay off your things. I don&#8217;t
have folks staying with me often, but I&#8217;m glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This she said with a certain heartiness that went
straight to Marion&#8217;s heart. She held up her face for
a welcoming kiss, and, blushing like a young girl,
Aunt Betty, after a quick look around the room, as
if to be sure no one saw her, bent down, and kissed
for the first time in twenty years.</p>
<p>Then Marion followed her up some steep stairs,
leading from the kitchen to an unfinished room
under the rafters. Here everything again was as
neat as wax, but how desolate! An unpainted bedstead
of pine wood, holding a round feather-bed covered
with a blue-and-white homespun bed-quilt; a
strip of rag carpet on a floor grown beautiful from
the care bestowed upon it; a small table covered with
a homespun linen towel, a Bible in exactly the middle
of it; two old yellow chairs, and not another
thing.</p>
<p>It was lighted by a three-cornered window, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Marion learned afterward, being over the front door,
was considered the one choice ornament of the house.</p>
<p>In spite of its desolation, its neatness was still a
charm to her. It was, as she knew, the family homestead,
and that subtile influence, so strong yet so
indescribable, seemed to her to brood over the room.
Here generation after generation of those whose
blood was running now so blithely through her veins
had lived, died, and gone out from it. Gently reverent
she stood on its threshold. Aunt Betty, looking
at her curiously, wondered at her.</p>
<p>It had never been warmed excepting from the heat
that had come up from the kitchen stove. For the
first time in her long life, Aunt Betty found herself
wishing there was a chimney and a large air-tight
stove in it; it would be fitter for a young girl like
this visitor.</p>
<p>But Marion had been by no means accustomed to
luxuries. She made herself at home at once. She
hung her hat upon a nail which was carefully covered
with white cloth to prevent its rusting anything,
and put her valise, not upon the table with the Bible,
or on the clean, blue bed-quilt, but up in a corner by
itself.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty watched all these movements, every
now and then nodding her gray head in silent
approval.</p>
<p>Then they went back to the kitchen, Marion taking
a Greek play with her to read,&mdash;one of Euripides.
She had promised herself much pleasure during this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
short vacation in finishing the play which her class
were studying at the end of the term.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty, walking back and forth around the
kitchen, stopped now and then at her elbow, and
peeped curiously inside the open leaves.</p>
<p>An object of Marion&#8217;s in taking the book had been
to relieve her aunt of any feeling that she must entertain
her; if she had been older and wiser she would
have seen her mistake.</p>
<p>She was trying to puzzle out a line of the chorus,
when a voice said close to her ear,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be that a Bible you are readin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion gave a little start, certainly there was nothing
very Scriptural in the play.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o-o,&#8221; she stammered; &#8220;it&#8217;s a Greek play, a&mdash;a
tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tragedy! you don&#8217;t read none of them wicked
things!&#8221; severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, auntie, when they come in the course
of my study. It&#8217;s in Greek!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Greek! and you&#8217;re a gal! Your father allers
was cracked about it, but this beats all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion failed to see it in just that light, but she
said pleasantly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put it away if it troubles
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long arm pointed up-stairs, and Marion followed
its direction.</p>
<p>When she came down, it seemed to Aunt Betty,
in spite of her displeasure, that the rays of sunlight
that were glimmering so faintly at the head of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
stairs came down with her and lighted up the dingy
old kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now give me something to do,&#8221; said Marion
dancing up to her with one of the prettiest steps she
had learned at the academy. &#8220;It&#8217;s Thanksgiving,
you know, to-morrow, and we have such lots and lots
to do at home; there&#8217;s pies and puddings and cakes
and a big turkey to prepare, and a chicken pie, and
nuts to crack, and apples to rub until you can see
your face in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Betty&#8217;s mouth and eyes opened as wide as
they could for the wrinkles that held them while
Marion told of the festival dinner, then she looked
down at Marion&#8217;s feet, and, not satisfied with the
glimpse she caught of a pair of little boots, she lifted
Marion&#8217;s dress, then asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be you lame?&#8221;</p>
<p>At first Marion was puzzled, then she remembered
how she had danced into the room, so, with a merry
peal of laughter, instead of answering, off she went
into a series of <i>pirouettes</i> that might have astonished
more accustomed eyes than those of her old Aunt
Betty.</p>
<p>When she had danced herself out of breath she
said, &#8220;Does that look like being lame? Better set
me at work and let me use my feet to some more
useful purpose!&#8221;</p>
<p>So still and stiff Aunt Betty stood that Marion
could hardly restrain herself from catching hold of
her and whirling her around in a waltz.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>But fortunately she did not, for the first words her
aunt said were,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have Satan for a principal at your school,
Marion Parke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Satan! Why, auntie, we have Miss Ashton, and
she&#8217;s the loveliest Christian lady you ever saw. We
girls think she is almost an angel! Do you think
it&#8217;s wicked to dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartain I do;&#8221; and the shake of Aunt Betty&#8217;s
gray head left no doubt she was in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll not dance while I am here,&#8221; and Marion
sat herself down demurely in the nearest chair.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty looked at the big clock in the corner
of the kitchen. The early dark was already creeping
into the room, hiding itself under table and chair,
showing the light of the isinglass doors of the cooking-stove
with a fitful radiance, making Marion lonely
and homesick, for you could hear the clock tick, the
room was so still. Then Aunt Betty lighted two
yellow tallow candles that stood in iron candlesticks
on the mantel-shelf, put up a leaf of the kitchen
table, covered it with a clean homespun cloth, put
upon it two blue delft plates and cups, a &#8220;chunk&#8221;
of cold boiled pork, a bowl of cider apple-sauce, a loaf
of snow-white bread, and a plate of doughnuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to supper!&#8221; she said, and Marion went.
How hungry she was, and how good everything,
even the cold boiled pork, looked, she will not soon
forget!</p>
<p>Before they seated themselves, Aunt Betty stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
at the back of her chair, and, leaning on its upper
round with her eyes fixed on the pork, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;For all our vittles and other marcies we thank
Thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion, when she became aware of what was taking
place, bowed her head reverently; but when she
raised it she could not conceal the smile that played
around her mouth.</p>
<p>She did not know this was the same grace which
had been said over that table for one hundred and
twenty years; yet it made her feel more at home, and
she began to chat with her quaint old relative in her
pleasant way, telling her of her home, of their daily
life there, of the good her father was doing, and how
every one loved and respected him.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty listened in silence, only now and then
uttering a grunt, which, whether it was commendatory
or condemnatory, Marion could not tell. It
was a long, dull evening that followed. At eight,
one of the tallow candles, much to her joy, lighted
Marion to her bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>THE ACADEMY GIRL&#8217;S THANKSGIVING AT THE OLD HOMESTEAD.</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion never knew that shortly after she fell
asleep a tall, gaunt woman with a gray-and-white
blanket over her shoulders stole softly into her room,
holding her candle high above her bed, and standing
over, peered down at her.</p>
<p>As she gazed, a half-smile crept into her rugged
face. &#8220;Pretty creatur!&#8221; she said aloud; then, with
deft and careful fingers she tucked the bed-clothes
close around the sleeping girl, smiled broadly, and
crept out.</p>
<p>The next morning when Marion waked, through
the odd little oriel window the late winter light was
struggling fitfully in. At first she could not tell
where she was: the rafters over her head, the bare
white walls that surrounded her, the blue-and-white
homespun quilt that covered her, were unlike any
thing she had ever seen before.</p>
<p>She was on her feet in a moment, half frightened
at the dim light. Had another night come? Had
she slept over Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>When she went to the kitchen, Aunt Betty was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
there busy over the cooking-stove. She was about
making an apology for her lateness, but she was
interrupted by,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Taint never too late to pray; you may read the
Bible.&#8221; She pointed without another word to the
old family Bible. Marion took it, opened it slowly,
waiting to be told where to read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanksgiving,&#8221; said Aunt Betty briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all Thanksgiving my father says. He thinks
the Bible was given us to make us happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-fourth Psalm, then,&#8221; and a quiet look came
into the old seamed face.</p>
<p>When Marion had read it, her aunt rose from her
chair, stepped behind it, tilted it on its front legs,
and folding her hands on its top began to pray.</p>
<p>Like the grace at table, it was the same old prayer
that had gone up from that same old kitchen for one
hundred and twenty years. Its quaint simplicity
was a marvel to the young girl who listened, but a
breath of its devotion reached and touched her heart.</p>
<p>Then followed breakfast. Marion wondered, as
they two sat at the table alone, how the old aunt could
have borne the loneliness for so many long years.</p>
<p>To her, on her first Thanksgiving away from her
cheerful home, there was something positively uncanny
in the silence which settled down over the
house; even the old yellow dog, with his nose between
his front paws, slept soundly, and the great red rooster
that had lighted upon the forked stick that before
the back door had held the farm milk-pails for more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
than a century, instead of calling for his Thanksgiving
breakfast, as orthodox New England roosters
are expected to do, just flapped his wings lazily, and
turned a much becombed head imploringly toward the
kitchen window.</p>
<p>What was to be done with the long, dull festival
day? Marion may be forgiven if she cast many longing
thoughts back to the academy, to the pleasant
bustle that filled the long corridors, the merry laughs
of the girls, the endless chatter, the coming and
the going that seemed to her never to cease. She
was homesick to see Miss Ashton, her room-mates,
and Helen, over whose daily life she had already installed
herself as responsible for its comforts and its
pleasures, and who, homeless and poor, remained
almost by herself in the great empty building.</p>
<p>She was not, however, left long in doubt as to the
day&#8217;s occupations. Hardly had the breakfast dishes
been put away, when Aunt Betty said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meetin&#8217; begins at ten. We hain&#8217;t got no bell,
and we&#8217;ll start in season. You can put on your
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clock said nine; meeting began at ten. Five
minutes were all she needed for preparation. Here
was time for a few lines at least of that Greek tragedy.
She had read one line, when the door opened,
and there stood Aunt Betty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Aunt Betty!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hear how
soft these words are.&#8221; Then she rattled off line
after line of the chorus. This is Greek, she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
pausing to take breath. &#8220;Listen! I will translate for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She carried her book to the oriel window, so the
light would fall more clearly on its page, and
began,&mdash;</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Before the mirror&#8217;s golden round,<br />
Curious my braided hair I bound,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.171875em;'>Adjusted for the night;</span><br />
And now, disrobed, for rest prepared,<br />
Sudden tumultuous cries are heard,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.171875em;'>And shrieks of wild affright.</span><br />

And bear triumphant her rich spoils away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that roll along sublimely? Can&#8217;t you
hear the cries and the shouts of the Grecian host?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hear Marion Parke making a fool of herself.
Be you, or be you not, goin&#8217; to meetin&#8217; with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meeting? Why, of course I am. I wouldn&#8217;t
miss it for anything. I&#8217;ll be ready in half a minute.
Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Betty, in her short black skirt, her old gray
sack, and her heavy shoes, did not make much of a
holiday appearance. Something of this crept slowly
into her brain as she looked down, so she turned
quickly, and went away without another word.</p>
<p>Marion gave some girl-like twists to her brown
hair, pinned a gay scarlet bow to the neck of her
sack, and, looking fresh and pretty as a rosebud,
went to the kitchen, where she had to wait some
time before Aunt Betty made her appearance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Cousin Abijah had brought the old horse and
sleigh round to the back door. Here a long slanting
roof ran down to the lintel of the door, and up
to the plain cornice snow-drifts lay piled. What a
winter scene it was! Marion, never having seen the
like before, gazed at it in wondering admiration.</p>
<p>When Aunt Betty and Marion started for the
village meeting-house, the thermometer was fifteen
degrees below zero.</p>
<p>Aunt Betty took a rein in each hand, and as soon
as the snow-banks bordering the narrow path to the
road were safely passed, began a series of jerks at
the horse&#8217;s mouth, which Dan perfectly well understood,
too well, indeed, to allow himself to be hurried
in the least.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;One foot up, and one foot down,<br />
That&#8217;s the way to Lunnon town,&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>laughed Marion when they had gone a few rods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Klick! Klick!&#8221; with more decisive tugs from
Dan&#8217;s mistress; but the &#8220;Klicks,&#8221; as well as the
tugs, were of no avail, and Marion, afraid to venture
another comment, turned her eyes from the horse to
the scenery around her.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the extreme cold, the ride to the
little meeting-house Marion will never forget. When
she left the farmhouse it seemed to her a short walk
would bring her to the foot of the snow-clad mountains;
but, to her surprise, when they reached the
church they were towering up above the small village
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
like huge sentinels, so still, so grand, that, hardly
conscious she was speaking aloud, Marion said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew before what it meant in the Bible
where it says, &#8216;The strength of the hills is his also.&#8217;
Wonderful! wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; asked Aunt Betty, only a dim comprehension
of what Marion meant having crept in beneath
the big red hood that covered her head.</p>
<p>Marion repeated the verse, and to her surprise her
aunt answered it with, &#8220;&#8216;Who art thou, O great
mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
with shoutings, crying grace! grace unto it.&#8217;&#8221; Not
a word did she offer in explanation; she only twitched
the horse&#8217;s head more emphatically, and did not speak
again until she reached the meeting-house door.</p>
<p>What a desolate-looking audience-room it was!
Up in one corner roared a big iron stove, which, do
its best, failed to warm but a few feet of the spaces
around it. A gray-bearded minister in his overcoat
was reading from the pulpit a hymn, as they went in,
and a dozen people, most of them men, were scattered
round in the bare pews.</p>
<p>They all looked pleased to see an addition to their
number, and some nodded to Aunt Betty; all stared
at the new-comer.</p>
<p>There was no sermon, but a short address, which
Marion strove to remember, that she might repeat
it to her father, as having come from the old pulpit
before which he had worshipped as a boy; but,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
do her best to be attentive and decorous, her teeth
chattered, and the &#8220;Amen&#8221; was to her the most
interesting part of the services.</p>
<p>The ride home was even colder than the one to the
meeting; for a brisk north-east wind had risen, and
came howling down from the mountains in strong,
long gusts that betokened a coming storm.</p>
<p>Dan obstinately refused to move one foot faster
than he chose, and before they reached home they
were thoroughly and, indeed, dangerously benumbed
with the cold.</p>
<p>Little thought had they of Thanksgiving, as they
clung to the warm stove and listened to the rising of
the wind. It was Marion who first remembered the
day, and looked about for some way of keeping it.
Poor, pinched, half-frozen Aunt Betty had entirely
forgotten it.</p>
<p>Now Marion made herself perfectly at home. She
found old-fashioned china that would have been held
precious in many houses, decorating with it the table
in a deft and tasteful way that warmed lonely Aunt
Betty&#8217;s heart, as she watched her, more than the
blazing fire could; and while she worked, she talked,
or sang little snatches of college songs learned at
school, which rippled out in her rich voice with a melody
never heard in the old farmhouse before.</p>
<p>It was not long before Aunt Betty came to her
help, and such a bountiful dinner as she had prepared
made Marion wish over and over again that Helen,
alone in that large academy building, could have
been there to share it with her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanksgiving night!&#8221; Marion kept saying this
to herself over and over again, as she sat alone with
Aunt Betty over the kitchen stove.</p>
<p>A little oblong light stand was drawn up between
them, holding a small kerosene lamp. Not a book
but the Bible, and a copy of the Farmer&#8217;s Almanac
suspended by a string from the corner of the mantel,
was to be seen. Marion, having heard so much of
the intelligence of the New Hampshire farmers, supposed
of course there would be a library in the house,
and had brought only her Greek Tragedy with her.
This she did not dare open again, so there she sat,
Aunt Betty, not having yet entirely recovered from
the effects of her cold ride, alternately nodding and
rousing herself to a vain effort to keep her eyes open.
And all the time the storm was increasing, the wind
rocking the house with its rough blasts, until it
seemed to utter loud groans, and the sharp cold
snapping and cracking the shaking timbers with
short volleys of sound like gun-shots. Frightened
mice scurried about in the low roof over the kitchen;
and rats, lonely rats, seeking company, came to the
top of the cellar stairs, pushing the door open with
their pointed noses, and blinking in beseechingly
with their big round eyes.</p>
<p>Marion, who had never heard anything of the kind
before, was really frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Aunt Betty,&#8221; she said piteously, &#8220;do, please,
wake up and tell me if there are ghosts here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Betty just stared at her; she was wide
awake now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are such dreadful noises, and such mice,
and&mdash;and rats!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Aunt Betty, listening. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be a coward! It&#8217;s only the storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fearful! What can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop corn!&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion could not help laughing at the inconsequent
answer; but anything was better than the
noisy stillness of the last hour, and bringing a large
brass warming-pan and some corn, they were soon
busy popping the corn.</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to say which of the
two enjoyed the sport the most. It carried Marion
home, where the family were all gathered together
before the brisk fire in the cheerful sitting-room.
Aunt Betty was young again. Nat and Sam, Bertha
and Molly, and little Ruth filled the big, empty
kitchen, laughed merrily over the crackling corn,
held out small hands to catch it as the cover swung
back, pelted each other with it till the spotless floor
crunched beneath their dancing feet. It had been
long years since they had come home to her before
on Thanksgiving night, but here they were now, all
evoked by Marion&#8217;s glad youth.</p>
<p>The moment the old clock struck nine, warming-pan,
corn, and dishes vanished from sight.</p>
<p>A long tallow-dip Aunt Betty held out to Marion,
and pointed up-stairs.</p>
<p>Marion obeyed; and though all night long the wind
howled, the mice and the rats held high carnival,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Marion slept soundly, and never knew that Aunt
Betty, with her candle held high above her head,
made another visit to her bedside, and there, bending
her old knees, offered up her simple prayer, asking
in much faith and love God&#8217;s blessing on this
new-found niece.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>MARION&#8217;S REPENTANCE.</h3>
</div>
<p>No time had been mentioned for the continuance
of Marion&#8217;s visit; and coming as she had from the
busy life of the school, where every minute had its
allotted task, Thanksgiving week was hardly over
before she began to be very homesick. In vain she
strove against it, and by every pleasant device in
her power tried to make her visit pleasant to her
aunt. Even the short November days seemed to
her endless, and the evenings had only the early bedtime
to make them endurable.</p>
<p>On her first coming, she had told Aunt Betty the
day the vacation was over, and evidently she was
expected to stay until then; but on the morning of
the seventh day she became desperate, and for want
of any other excuse hit upon one that would be most
displeasing to her aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like to have me study my Greek here,
Aunt Betty,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and, as I must review it
before the term begins, I think I had better go back
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Betty put her steel-bowed spectacles high
up on her nose, and, after looking at her silently for
a moment, said,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t take no stock in your Greek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;If you only
would let me read it to you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you would
like it as well as I do; it&#8217;s so soft and beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your Bible? Isn&#8217;t that
good enough for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Betty, you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Aunt Betty did understand enough to be very
sure she did not want Marion to go, so she turned
abruptly on her heel, and hid herself in the depths
of the pantry.</p>
<p>Marion stood for a moment undecided what to do,
then, seeing that if she would go that day she had
very little time to lose, she went up-stairs, packed
her valise, and the next time she saw her aunt was
ready for her journey back.</p>
<p>The prospect of a mile walk through the half-broken
roads, up steep hills, and down into drifted
valleys, would have shown Marion the difficulties had
she been a New Englander; but as she was not,
her courage did not fail in the least when, without
a word more, or any sign of a good-by from Aunt
Betty, she opened the door, letting in a cold she was
a stranger to, and went out into it.</p>
<p>Of that walk she never liked to speak afterwards.
Many times she stopped, almost but not quite willing
to return; tired, half-frozen, and unhappy that her
rest had terminated unpleasantly, yet so very, very
homesick that she seemed driven on to the station,&mdash;if
to reach it were a possibility.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Fortunately for her, when she had reached the
last half she was overtaken by a man driving an
empty wood-cart, who stopped and asked her if she
&#8220;didn&#8217;t want a lift?&#8221; From what this saved her, no
one could ever know.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Aunt Betty, with her eyes
dimmed&mdash;but she did not know it was by tears&mdash;had
watched her through a slit in a green paper
window-shade.</p>
<p>Until she left the door, she did not believe she
could do so foolish a thing as to attempt the walk to
the station on such a morning; but when she saw her
step off so courageously down the narrow foot-path,
she began to have misgivings.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding her tears, the sight seemed to
harden instead of soften her heart. &#8220;If the gal
will go, go she will,&#8221; she said aloud, with some
unforgiving wags of her head. &#8220;She&#8217;s stuck full of
obstinacy as her father was afore her.&#8221; And by
this time Marion was hidden from her sight by the
deep snow-banks, and she turned from the window
into her lonely kitchen with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Marion, safely back in the academy, had, like Aunt
Betty, her own troubled thoughts.</p>
<p>She found only Helen there among the scholars,
and every teacher away but Miss Ashton, who evidently
had not expected her back so soon.</p>
<p>Regular school duties did not begin until Tuesday
of the next week, and now it was only Wednesday
night. She might have remained in Belden a day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
or two longer, and then left with her aunt&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>What kind of a return had she made to her aunt
for her kindness?</p>
<p>Marion&#8217;s room, that she had thought of with so
much longing as she sat in the farm kitchen, had
lost its charm. She was very willing to believe it
was because her room-mates were not there, and the
fast falling darkness prevented her from seeing from
her window the winter view, which even the grand
old mountains that she had left behind her did not
make her value less.</p>
<p>Self-deception was not one of Marion&#8217;s faults; she
grew so quickly regretful for what had happened,
that when Miss Ashton came to her door, troubled
by the girl&#8217;s tired look on her arrival, she found her
with red eyes and a swollen face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it,&#8221; she said, taking no notice
of her tears, but turning up the gas to make the
room more cheerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has gone wrong? Wasn&#8217;t your aunt glad
to see you? Are you sick? Fancy I am mother,
and tell me the whole story.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took Marion&#8217;s hand in hers, drew the young
girl close to her, and stroked the bonnie brown hair
with a loving mother&#8217;s touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all my blame,&#8221; said Marion, her voice trembling
as she spoke. &#8220;My aunt was as kind as she
could be, but it was so lonely, and&#8221;&mdash;with a smile
now&mdash;&#8220;so noisy there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Noisy!&#8221; repeated Miss Ashton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am; there were ghosts and rats and
mice; the very house groaned and shook, and the
wind came howling down from the mountains, and
all the windows rattled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ashton only laughed; but when Marion went
on to tell the story of her leaving the house against
her aunt&#8217;s wishes, she looked very sober.</p>
<p>She had no knowledge of Aunt Betty&#8217;s circumstances,
surroundings, or character, but she knew
well the nature of country roads during a New
England winter. She thought from Marion&#8217;s own
account that her homesickness had made her obstinate
and unreasonable, and that her coming away
must have been a source of anxiety to her aunt,
while she was unable to prevent it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you think more
of yourself than of your aunt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Marion unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to be selfish is always?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean. Don&#8217;t say another word please, Miss
Ashton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, Marion, in the future you will be
more careful. It is such an easy thing to wound
and worry those about whom we should always be
thoughtful. If I were you, I would not let a mail
go out without carrying a note to your aunt, telling
her of your safe arrival here, and of your regrets for
what has happened. It&#8217;s always a noble thing to
say &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8217; when one has done wrong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>The next mail took the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Aunt</span>,&mdash;I am going to write you to-night, to tell you
two things. One is, that I am safely back again at the academy, and
the other, that I think it was both inconsiderate and unkind for me
to leave you as I did, when I saw you thought I had better stay with
you. I am ashamed and grieved that I did not do as you wanted
me to. I hope most sincerely you will forgive me and forget it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>I cannot easily forgive myself, and I am sure I shall never forget
all your kindness to me, or the nice time we had with the bright
warming-pan and the crisp pop-corn, or the wonderful mountains all
wrapped in their ermine mantles.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 4.296875em;'>Please forgive, and love your ashamed niece,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Marion Parke</span>.</span><br /></p>
<p>Aunt Betty&#8217;s correspondence amounted sometimes
to two letters a year, so this penitent letter of
Marion&#8217;s remained in the post-office until the postmaster
found a chance to send it to her. By that
time, what she had suffered from anxiety had made
her unable to cope with the perils of the winter
before her, and she often said to the few visitors
who came in to see her, &#8220;I&#8217;ve dropped a stitch I
can never take up again,&#8221; but never a word of blame
for Marion did she speak; indeed, she had come to
love the young girl so well, that it is doubtful whether,
even in her heart, she harbored one hard thought
toward her.</p>
<p>The letter finished, Marion&#8217;s conscience gave her
less uneasiness. No thought had she of the suffering
her selfish action had occasioned. The visit had,
after all, many pleasant memories, and for her only
beneficial results. There had come to her from her
repentance and Miss Ashton&#8217;s kind reproof, a lesson,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
if not new, at least impressive, of the necessity of
thinking of others more than of one&#8217;s self.</p>
<p>She could not see her Greek Tragedy without a
smile, indeed, she went so far as sometimes to think
that its reception in the old kitchen of the farmhouse
had given her a greater avidity for its study.</p>
<p>On the whole, this winter visit was by no means
a lost one; and when Saturday brought more of the
scholars back, and the term began, she was fully
ready for it.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning Nellie, feeling lonely and sick,
had come to Marion&#8217;s room. Marion made a nice
bed for her on her sofa, and sat by her side bathing
her hot, aching head, now and then reading to her.</p>
<p>Toward night she complained of her throat; fearing
Miss Ashton would send her to the nurse if she
were told of it, she would not let Marion go to her,
but begged to stay where she was so piteously that
Marion gladly consented, asking leave of the teacher,
but not mentioning Nellie&#8217;s sickness.</p>
<p>The consequence was, that the disease progressed
rapidly, and when morning came she was too sick
even to object to the nurse, who, surprised and bewildered,
sent for Miss Ashton at once.</p>
<p>Dr. Dawson, the physician of twenty years&#8217; academical
sickness, being summoned, pronounced it a
case of diphtheria, and ordered Nellie&#8217;s removal to the
rooms used as a hospital, and Marion&#8217;s separation
from the rest of the school, as she had been exposed
to the same disease.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>DIPHTHERIA.</h3>
</div>
<p>On Tuesday the regular exercises of the day were
to begin. All day Monday, carriage after carriage
came driving up to the academy, depositing their
loads of freight,&mdash;excited girls full of the freshness
and pleasure gathered from their brief holiday. The
long corridors were merry with affectionate osculations.
Light, happy laughs danced out from rosy
lips, and arms were twined and intertwined in the
loving clasp of young girls. So much to tell! So
much to hear! Miss Ashton, welcoming the coming
groups, called it a &#8220;Thanksgiving Pandemonium;&#8221;
but she enjoyed it quite as much as any of the rioters.
In the evening, when they were all together
in the large parlor, she turned the gathering into a
pleasant party, helped to fill it with fun and frolic,
and sent even the most homesick to their rooms with
smiles instead of tears.</p>
<p>Not a word had been said of Nellie Blair&#8217;s sickness.
There is no place where a panic is more easily started
and harder to control than in a girls&#8217; school; nor is
there any cause that will so surely awaken it as a
case of diphtheria. Its acute suffering, its often sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
end, its contagiousness, all combine to make it
the most dreaded of diseases.</p>
<p>Some reason had to be given, of course, for the
condition in which Marion&#8217;s room-mates found their
room on their arrival, also for Marion&#8217;s removal.
Miss Ashton had guardedly told them the truth, with
the strictest request that they should keep it to themselves;
but, in spite of her injunction, that night
after the party broke up, there was not a girl in the
hall who did not know and who was not alarmed by
Nellie&#8217;s sickness.</p>
<p>Anxious groups gathered together in the corridors
and discussed it. Some fled to their rooms and
wrote hurried notes home, asking for leave to come
back at once. The panic had begun, augmented
beyond doubt by the excitement consequent on the
return. Miss Ashton was besieged by girls, all
anxious to know the exact state of the case, and
not a few clamoring for leave to go away, even that
very night, from the contagion.</p>
<p>Had she any less influence over this frightened
crowd, or they any less trust in her wisdom and kindness,
half of the rooms would have been empty before
morning; but, as it was, simply by telling them the
truth, that Nellie had diphtheria, but that the doctor
said that it was not a malignant case, and that there
was not the slightest danger of its spreading, with even
ordinary care, she succeeded in so far quieting their
fears that they went to their rooms, though, if she
had only known it, to discuss with even more excitement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
than they had shown to her the dreadful possibilities
before them.</p>
<p>One girl actually stole out at midnight and, hurrying
through the cold and darkness, went to the house
of a cousin who lived near by, waking and alarming the
family in a way that they found hard to forgive, and
taking by this exposure so severe a cold that, serious
lung symptoms developing, she was sent home, and
her academical course ended. The next morning
when the school gathered in the chapel, they found
Dr. Dawson on the stage.</p>
<p>After the preliminary exercises were over, he rose,
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Young ladies, I understand you have taken fright
on account of the case of diphtheria that is occurring
here. I am an old man, as you see, and have had a
hundred, perhaps five hundred cases as like this as
two peas in a pod.&#8221; (He stopped, expecting a smile
at least for his homely comparison, but every face
was as sober as if he had come to sound a death-knell.)
&#8220;Miss Blair <i>is</i> sick, I might say is <i>very</i> sick,
but I am not in the least anxious about her, or about
any of you. Under ordinary circumstances, and I
consider these very ordinary, I think there is not
any probability of another case in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take an old physician&#8217;s advice. Stay where you
are, go promptly and faithfully about your regular
duties, don&#8217;t mention the word diphtheria, and don&#8217;t
think of it. If I were a life-insurance agent, I would
insure those of you who obeyed my injunctions for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
half the premium that I would those who worry
over this, or run away. Again I say, go faithfully
about your ordinary duties, and all of you&#8221; (dropping
his voice into solemn tones now) &#8220;ask God to be
with and protect you, and restore to you your sick
companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he took up his hat and marched down
through the long, girl-bordered aisle, smiling and
nodding to those he knew as he went.</p>
<p>On the whole, his speech did little to allay the
panic. He had not only allowed that Nellie was
<i>very</i> sick, but he had talked about &#8220;life-insurance,&#8221;
and asking God for protection. Qualms of fear followed
him as he went. Miss Ashton understood the
assembly better than the wise physician, and before
he had closed the door she regretted that she had
asked him to address them.</p>
<p>One part of his advice, however, was sound; that
regarding to the scholars at once resuming their
work, and putting diphtheria out of conversation and
mind. If only good advice could or would always be
taken, what a different world it would be!</p>
<p>Fortunately here, among these two hundred girls,
there were leaders both sensible and trusted, who did
follow the doctor&#8217;s advice, went at once about their
studies, and ably seconded the exertions of the
teachers to resume the usual routine of work.</p>
<p>Among the most prominent of these was Dorothy
Ottley. She had that indescribable moral power
over the girls which comes, and one is tempted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
say comes only, from a consistent, faithful, gentle,
loving character. She did not draw to herself that
impulsive love which is here to-day and gone to-morrow,
so common among girls; but if any were sad or
sick or in trouble they instinctively sought Dorothy,
and they always found in her what they needed.</p>
<p>She was plain looking; her sea-browned face, her
thin, light hair that wind and wave had bleached,
the pathetic look that years of a hard life had
stamped upon her, could not conceal, could not even
dim, the strong, true soul that looked out of her gray
eye, or change the effect of the honest words her
lips always spoke. Now, wherever she went, the
girls clustered around her, followed her example in
prompt attendance on the regular duties, and somehow,
no one could have told you just how, felt safer
that she was there.</p>
<p>Marion, Miss Ashton kept from among them. If
she had been exposed to the disease from Nellie&#8217;s
being with her, it might be best not to allow her to
mingle with the others; besides, they would shun her,
and that Marion would find hard to bear. As it was
not known except to her room-mates that she had
returned from her vacation, this was easy to do;
and so in the pleasant guest-room Marion went on
with her studies without a fear of diphtheria, only
thinking of, and anxious for, the sick friend.</p>
<p>It was Gladys who began the series of attentions
that on the second day filled Nellie&#8217;s room with
gifts of flowers, of fruit, of books, even of candy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
pretty toys, which the girls had already begun to
gather for the coming Christmas. Miss Mason, the
trained nurse, was kept busy at certain hours answering
the teacher&#8217;s knock who brought the gifts and
the accompanying love,&mdash;and Nellie, poor Nellie,
struggling with the pain and the uncertainty, was
cheered and helped by loving attentions given to her
for the first time in her desolate life.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton, hearing every hour from the sickroom,
shared in the cheer and the help; there was
a reward to her in this proof of the tenderness and
generosity of that wonderful woman&#8217;s nature she
had made it her life&#8217;s work to develop and train.</p>
<p>Each day there was a bulletin put up in the hall,
stating Nellie&#8217;s condition. It was always cheerful.
Miss Ashton wrote,&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie is cross this morning. Dr. Dawson pronounces
it the best symptom he has seen since she
was taken sick.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie has asked for a piece of that mince-pie
one of you sent her. Nurse says, &#8216;No,&#8217; but looks
much pleased at the request.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Rejoicing in the hospital! a decided improvement
in Nellie.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie teases to sit up.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie lifted onto the sofa! Dressed in my old
blue wrapper! Looks white and funny.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie sends her love and thanks to all her kind,
kind friends.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie teasing to see Marion Parke.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie pronounced out of danger.&#8221;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Nellie removed to Mrs. Gaston&#8217;s, where she will
stay until she is strong enough to resume her studies.
Sends love and thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day there were rumors around the
school that Marion Parke, who had been missed by
this time, and accounted for, was taken sick with
diphtheria, and was much worse than Nellie had ever
been.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the panic began anew; and as
many of the girls had written home and obtained
leave to return, more than that, commands to do so,
as the sick girl&#8217;s case was contagious, Miss Ashton
found all her trouble renewed.</p>
<p>She had been besieged with letters from anxious
parents, charging her not to trifle with their children&#8217;s
lives, but by all means to send them home at once if
there was the least real danger; so now she had no
hesitation in letting those go who wished, indeed it
was a relief to her to have the number of her school
smaller, and the anxiety lessened; but now it was
only a scare. Marion did have a sore throat, but it
was one which comes often with an ordinary cold,
and Dr. Dawson laughed at it, gave her some slight
medicines, and scolded Miss Ashton for having separated
her so long from the girls.</p>
<p>The girls gave her a wide berth, but for this Miss
Ashton had prepared her, and Marion was more
amused than hurt by it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>Before a week had passed, the four room-mates
were together in their old rooms, and Marion was
made a heroine. All she had done for Nellie was
exaggerated, with that generous exaggeration of
which girls are so capable.</p>
<p>After all, this diphtheritic episode had only been
injurious to the school inasmuch as it had broken
into the regular routine, and thrown hindrances into
the completion of work which was expected to be
done before the coming on of the long holiday
vacation.</p>
<p>That Christmas and New Year&#8217;s came so soon
after Thanksgiving was something for the teachers
to deplore; but as they were in no way responsible
for it, and as indeed Christmas was a religious holiday,
well in keeping with the <i>animus</i> of the institution,
they met it heartily, the more so than usual
this year, as they hoped, the vacation over, to resume
the regular course, both in study and discipline, without
any further interruption.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRISTMAS COMING.</h3>
</div>
<p>The Demosthenic Club had received two severe setbacks
since its organization. One when Kate Underwood&#8217;s
tableaux fell under Miss Ashton&#8217;s displeasure
on account of the carelessness it had shown in injuring,
for fun&#8217;s sake, the feelings of a schoolmate;
the other when members of the club had been
guilty of a flagrant breach of the rules, by the stolen
sleigh-ride with the Atherton boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;In spite of it all,&#8221; Kate Underwood said, &#8220;we will
just change its name, and go on as if nothing had
happened. We are to be now the &#8216;Never Say Die
Club.&#8217; Vote on it, girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new name was adopted by acclamation, and
several other votes were carried at the same time, all
in favor of law and order, showing how truly these
girls had meant to keep the promises they had made
in their extremity to Miss Ashton, to be law-abiding
members of the school.</p>
<p>They held their secret meetings as often and as
secretly as their constitution demanded; they discussed
all questions that the interests of the times
suggested. If they had a spread, it was before study
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
hours, and with unlocked doors. On the whole,
Jenny Barton, Kate Underwood, and Mamie Smythe
took the lessons they had received into good, honest
hearts, and grew, by the many resisted temptations
which were born of the secrecy of their club, into
better, nobler characters.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton, watching them with vigilant eyes,
marked the improvement, and showed her value of it
by greater confidence in its leading members.</p>
<p>There was an important meeting to be held a
week before the breaking up for the Christmas vacation.
It was to be in Lilly White&#8217;s room, where,
indeed, most of their meetings were held, for Lilly
had a room by herself, richly furnished, this being
the only inducement her parents could offer her,
that made her consent to the fearful ordeal of a few
years at school,&mdash;to be dull and to be wealthy!
Who would desire it for any child?</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand,&#8221; said President Jenny Barton,
after the meeting was called to order, &#8220;that this is to
be no common affair. It&#8217;s to be, well! it&#8217;s to be a
sort of atonement for&mdash;well, for those other affairs;
and, girls, if we do anything about it, let&#8217;s do it up
handsome. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it jist illigant, or let it alone,&#8221; said Mamie
Smythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jist illigant!&#8221; repeated one member of the club
after another, until the president said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Motioned, and carried. Now for our plan. Keep
it a profound secret!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Such a busy place as the academy became now,
probably had its counterpart in every girls&#8217; boarding-school
all over the length and breadth of our
land.</p>
<p>Where there is good discipline and good scholarship,
neither the rules nor the lessons are allowed to
be slighted; but as December days shorten, and
December cold strengthens, even the most indolent
pupil finds herself under a certain stress of occupation
which she cannot resist.</p>
<p>Shirking can find no place in the recitation-room.
Moments that have been idled away now become
precious, each one laden with its weight of some
loving remembrance to be made for the dear ones at
home.</p>
<p>Such treasures of delicate silks, laces, plushes,
velvets, ribbons, embroideries, card-boards, tassels,
cords, gilt in every shape and capable of every use;
such pretty gift-books, booklets, cards, afghans, sofa-pillows,
head-rests; such wonders of ingenuity in
working up places for thermometers, putting them
in dust-pans, tying them onto bread-rollers, slipping
them behind wonderful clusters of sweet painted
flowers; such pen-wipers, such blotters, work-baskets,
paper-baskets, bureau coverings, bureau mats! napery
of all varieties; and, after all, this enumeration
is but the beginning of what in Montrose Academy
was hidden in drawers, stowed away in most impossible
and impracticable places, yet always ready
to the hand for a spare moment. Two hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
girls,&mdash;for by this time most of the diphtheritic runaways
had returned,&mdash;and all, without an exception,
were Christmas busy! Christmas crazy! What a
changed place it made of the school!</p>
<p>Benedictions on the hallowed holiday! If we put
aside its religious bearing, think of it only as a time
when heart goes out to heart, even the most selfish
of us all will remember to show our love in a visible
token of affection.</p>
<p>If, with all this, we can make our offerings hallowed
by a tenderer love and a deeper affection for
Him in whose honor the whole world keeps the festival,
then, indeed, the day becomes to us the most
blessed and beautiful of our lives!</p>
<p>Marion Parke saw it as it was kept here in an entirely
new way. At her Western home, her father
had made it a day of religious observance. Marion
had always been leader in trimming their church with
the pretty greens which their mild winter spared to
them, and on Christmas Sunday they sang Christmas
hymns, and listened to a Christmas sermon. On
Christmas Eve they had a Christmas-tree, and hung
it with such useful gifts as their necessities demanded
and a small purse could provide. It was a happy,
precious day, simply and heartily kept; but here she
was lost in wonder, as she was called from room to
room to see the rare and beautiful gifts which, it
seemed to her, abounded everywhere. Money to
purchase such things for herself to give away she
had not, but she watched her room-mates, as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
deftly prepared their gifts for their Rock Cove homes,
with delight.</p>
<p>How busy and happy they were! Sometimes
Marion&#8217;s longing to send something, if only a little
remembrance, home brought the tears into her
eyes.</p>
<p>Gladys was the first to see this and to guess its
cause. At once she began to purchase new silks,
trimmings of all kinds, booklets, cards, increasing her
store, until even her cousins, accustomed as they were
to her fitful extravagances, wondered at her.</p>
<p>When her drawers, never too orderly, began to
assume a chaotic appearance, she said fretfully one
morning to Marion Parke, who was looking and
laughing at the chaos,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think, instead of laughing at me, it would
be a great deal better natured in you to help me put
them into some kind of order. Your drawer isn&#8217;t
half full. Look here! open it, and let me tuck some
of these duds in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion opened hers, pushed the few things it contained
carefully into a corner, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very welcome to all the room you want.
Remember, I am only here on sufferance; it is really
all yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! help me, can&#8217;t you? I shall pitch
them in any way, and you are so tidy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Help her Marion did, and when the jumbled but
valuable contents of the drawer were all transferred,
Gladys shut it up with a gleeful laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how splendid it is,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to have the
drawer clean and clear again! Never one of those
duds is going back, and you can use them or throw
them away; put them in a rag-bag if you want to;
I&#8217;ve nothing more to do with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Sue and Dorothy understood what the extravagance
meant, but Marion did not; she only stood
still, staring at Gladys, wondering what she could
have said or done to vex her kind-hearted room-mate.
And it was not until hours afterward, when she was
alone with Dorothy, and Dorothy told her they were
gifts to her, that she knew how rich in Christmas
treasures she had suddenly become.</p>
<p>And here it is pleasant to tell, that this was only
one of Gladys&#8217;s thoughtful kindnesses. Little bundles
of similar gifts were constantly going from her to the
doors of the girls whose small means made Christmas
presents luxuries in which they could not indulge.
Even Gladys&#8217;s liberal father wondered often over the
amount of money which she wished for these holidays;
but he trusted her, and in truth felt proud and
glad that this only child had a noble, generous nature,
which could, and did, think of others more than of
herself; for in the account which she always sent him
of the expenditure of these moneys, while there were
many &#8220;give aways,&#8221; there were few dollars spent on
herself.</p>
<p>One day, in the regular mail-bag, there came this
note to Miss Ashton:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>We, the undersigned, grateful for the undeserved kindnesses with
which you have made our repentant days so happy, request the pleasure
of your company in the parlor, Tuesday evening, December 22.</p>

<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Martha Dodd</span>,<br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><i>and all the members of the &#8220;Never Say Die Club.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;What are those girls up to now?&#8221; Miss Ashton
said with a pleasant laugh, as she read the invitation,
but she accepted it without any delay, and when she
was told by Miss Newton, the confidential helper of
the whole school in any of their wants, that the parlor
had been lent to the secret society for the evening,
and no teacher was to be allowed entrance until
eight o&#8217;clock, she smilingly acquiesced.</p>
<p>The club were excused from their recitations that
afternoon, and it was amusing to see how much spying
there was among the rest of the school to find
out what was going on. All that could be seen,
however, was the coming in of a big boxed article,
unfortunately for the curious, so boxed that no one
could even guess what it contained.</p>
<p>A general invitation had been given to the whole
school, and before the appointed hour for opening
the door, groups of girls in full evening dress began
to fill the corridor and press close to the door.</p>
<p>When, punctual to the appointed moment, it was
flung open, a burst of laughter followed.</p>
<p>Ranged around a covered object in the middle of
the room stood twenty girls, dressed in gray flannel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
blankets made in the fashion of the penitential robes
worn by nuns. They all wore stiff white hoods,
with the long capes coming down over their shoulders,
and each one carried in her hand a small tin pan
filled to the brim with ashes.</p>
<p>They stood immovable until Miss Ashton entered
the room, when the whole club sank upon their
knees, bending their heads until they nearly touched
the floor, dexterously placing the tin of ashes upon
their backs.</p>
<p>No sooner had they assumed this position than a
little flag was unfurled from the top of the covered
object in the middle of the room, upon which was
printed in large letters:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>&#8220;FORGIVE, AND ACCEPT.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>Then the covering was slowly removed by some
one hidden beneath it, and there stood an elegant
writing-desk, on the front of which were the words:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>A Merry Christmas to Miss Ashton the Merciful<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRISTMAS IN THE ACADEMY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion, two days before Christmas, was once
more left alone in her room. The Rock Cove cousins
had given her the most cordial invitation to go
home with them for the vacation, but she had declined.
In doing so, she had a half-acknowledged
feeling that she was to suffer just penance for her
misdeeds at Belden, and a dread of what unknown
trouble she might meet at Rock Cove. This Eastern
world was so different from the whole-hearted,
kindly one she had left behind her, that instead of
wonting to it, she grew timid, diffident of herself,
even among the girls, and shy about venturing
abroad. So she made her mind up bravely to stay
where she was, and spend her vacation in study.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton fully approved; for since Marion&#8217;s
sickness with her cold, she had shown an inclination
to cough, and was often hoarse in the morning. A
stay by the seaside in winter would be to run a
risk. It might be dull for her to remain, but she
loved her books, and there was plenty for her to do
in order to keep up with her advanced classes;
besides, there were twenty of the pupils whose homes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
were so distant they could not go there, and return,
without taking more time than the vacation allowed,
so they, also, were to remain, and Marion, though
dull, need not be lonely.</p>
<p>All the teachers but Fr&auml;ulein Sausmann were to
be absent, and to her care Miss Ashton had to commit
the young ladies during the vacation.</p>
<p>The wheels of the carriage that took her away
from the academy had hardly ceased to be heard by
the anxious listeners there, before Marion&#8217;s door was
opened just far enough to admit the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s good-natured
face.</p>
<p>Never had her ample head of light hair looked so
large, her blue eyes so blue, her nose so <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>, or
her thin lips so thin, to Marion, as now. Before she
had time to welcome her, the Fr&auml;ulein said in her
high-pitched voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Marione! Wir happiness time wir have der
Christtag. Wir &#8217;ave der Baum so high,&#8221; holding up
a plump little hand as high as she could reach.
&#8220;Twenty, thirty das Licht! Christtag presented
buful! You &#8217;ave one, sieben, zw&ouml;lf, four! You
come happiness; nicht cry, nicht! nicht! Lachen!
so!&#8221; and a merry peal of laughter Marion found no
trouble in echoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come parlor Christtag night, you see! I,
Santa Claus! Merry Christtag. Catch you! Nicht
cry! Lachen! Lachen!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shut the door softly, but Marion heard her
laugh as she went down the long corridor, such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
merry, contagious laugh, that it carried away with it
the loneliness from Marion&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>There was to be a gathering in the parlor then,&mdash;der
Baum. Twenty, thirty das Licht, and what
else? Of one thing Marion felt sure, if she was to
receive, one, sieben, zw&ouml;lf, four presents, she must
give some in return, but what, and to whom?</p>
<p>She was not long in doubt. Lilly White was
among those who remained, and the Fr&auml;ulein had
hardly gone when she made her appearance with
four other girls at her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oui, Fr&auml;ulein Marione! Ab alio expectes, alteri
quod feceris.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s French, Latin, and German. I picked it
out of&#8221;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell, Lilly White,&#8221; broke in one of the
girls. &#8220;See if Marion can translate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in and let me try,&#8221; said Marion, laughing.
&#8220;Oui&mdash;yes; Fr&auml;ulein&mdash;Miss Marion; Ab alio expectes,
alteri quod feceris&mdash;If any one gives you a
present, be sure you give one back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A literal translation,&#8221; said the same girl. &#8220;Miss
Jones always said you were her best Latin scholar.
Practically, however, it translates,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with us to Lilly White&#8217;s room, and we&#8217;ll
show you a thing or two. But we mustn&#8217;t all go
together. If we do, the Fr&auml;ulein will be popping
down on us to be sure no mischief is brewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do; I will write in German
&#8216;No Admittance&#8217; on a big placard, and put it outside
my door. What is the German, girls?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
&#8220;Nicht Zulassung,&#8221; said one of the girls promptly.
&#8220;Write it, Lilly, in a big, bold hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went together to Lilly&#8217;s room; and she took
a large square of pasteboard, and, without deigning
to ask how the words were spelled, she printed in
big letters:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>&#8220;NOTTZ ULLARSG.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said, turning it triumphantly for
the others to read. Then she hung it on the outside
of the door, moved a table to the door, planted a
chair upon it, mounted into the chair, and peeped
down through the transom to watch for the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s
coming.</p>
<p>The others watched her, and all business for the
time was suspended.</p>
<p>Pretty soon they heard the pattering of the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s
little feet along the corridor, then the sudden
halting before their door.</p>
<p>Lilly, with a beet-red face, and frantic gestures of
two big red hands, motioned them to be still. They
heard,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;O&mdash;T&mdash;T&mdash;Z.&#8221; A significant grunt;
then again, &#8220;N&mdash;O&mdash;T&mdash;T&mdash;Z;&#8221; a pause.
Again, &#8220;N&mdash;O&mdash;T&mdash;T&mdash;Z U&mdash;L&mdash;L&mdash;A&mdash;R&mdash;S&mdash;G.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hindoostanee? No; Indianee: Marione Parkee!&#8221;
Then a little laugh, followed by,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marione! Marione! Ope die Thur! What you
mean, Nottz Ullarsg?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No admittance,&#8221; said Lilly White through the
transom. &#8220;Why, Fr&auml;ulein, don&#8217;t you know your
own German?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know my own German?&#8221; repeated the Fr&auml;ulein
slowly. &#8220;Know&mdash;my&mdash;own&mdash;German? Nein!
Nein! German, Lilly White! Nein Vater Land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lilly White, open die Thur, quickest! My own
German! Nein! Nein! Nein!</p>
<p>&#8220;Marione Parke&#8217;s Indianee!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was some moments before Lilly, the chair and
the table, could be removed from the door, the Fr&auml;ulein
keeping up a series of impatient knockings while
she waited.</p>
<p>Then Marion, as the one in whom she would feel
the greatest confidence, was pushed to the small
opening allowed, and told to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Christmas, almost, dear Fr&auml;ulein. It&#8217;s secrets
here now. We can&#8217;t let you in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indianee?&#8221; asked the Fr&auml;ulein, pointing to the
placard. &#8220;What you mean, Marione?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was meant to mean &#8216;No Admittance&#8217; in
German, Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such funny little shrieks as the Fr&auml;ulein uttered,
no one could understand, not even Marion, who was
looking in her face. There were anger and fun and
amazement, chasing each other in quick succession,
her hands beating time to each feeling, as an instrument
utters its music to the touch.</p>
<p>To the amazement of all, it ended in the Fr&auml;ulein
shrieking out,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lilly White! You be a&mdash;what you call um der
thor, narr, dummkopf, fool, idiotte; you know German,
nicht! nicht, you idiotte!&#8221;</p>
<p>In these hard words the little German teacher&#8217;s
anger wholly vanished; pulling down the placard, she
tore it in bits, gathered them up in her small white
apron, made a sweeping courtesy, and trotted away.</p>
<p>As soon as she was fairly out of hearing, the girls
began to busy themselves about their Christmas
work. Lilly White&#8217;s room was full of things to be
made into pretty gifts for the tree, of which the
Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s share was by far the largest.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful degree of thoughtfulness
among a company of girls. Not one there but knew
of Marion&#8217;s circumstances, and how impossible it
would be for her, out of her slender purse, to meet
the demands of the occasion. If Gladys Philbrick
had generously helped her to prepare the pretty
gifts which were on their way to her far-away home,
so these girls as generously planned that in the
Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s festival she should not find herself in the
embarrassing position of being the one who should
receive, without making a return.</p>
<p>It was beautiful to see the delicacy with which
they managed the whole, so that Marion hardly felt
how much they gave, and how pleasantly she received.</p>
<p>On Christmas morning the whole house was early
astir. All up and down the corridors, long before
the dim light penetrated into them, white-robed
figures flitted noiselessly from door to door. &#8220;Merry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Christmas! Merry Christmas!&#8221; was whispered inside,
until a ghost-like procession of some twenty
girls headed for the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>This was at the end of the second corridor, and
as they approached it not a sound was to be heard
from within but the satisfactory one of long and
loud snores.</p>
<p>It had been agreed on the previous night that not
a door should be locked on the inside, and Helen
Stratton, &#8220;the cute girl,&#8221; who could do anything she
tried to do, was chosen to open this door. This she
did so noiselessly, that the whole twenty girls entered
the room and surrounded the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s bed without
so much as interrupting a single snore. Then all at
once a merry chorus broke out with,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Fr&auml;ulein!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein stirred in her bed. Then another
shout, louder than the first, and she sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>The gas in the hall had been lighted, and stole in
through the transom sufficiently to give the ghost-like
look the girls sought; but even with this, she
was slow in comprehending what was happening.</p>
<p>One more shout, and she sprang out of bed, catching
the one nearest to her, and giving her a good,
hard shaking. &#8220;Der Christtag! Der Christtag!
Fr&ouml;hlich Weinacht! Fr&ouml;hlich; I wishes you &#8217;arpy
Christtag! What <i>you</i> call it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221; shouted the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Ja! Ja! Merrie Christmas! one Merrie
Christmas, a t&#8217;ousand Merrie Christmas. Now you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
go dress! Miss Ashton say, &#8216;Fr&auml;ulein, the young
ladies tak cough.&#8217; You catched me, I catched you
to-nacht. You see! gute nacht! gute nacht!&#8221;</p>
<p>And like a very small queen, in her pretty nightdress,
she waved the girls away, then locked her
door; if they had come back only a few minutes
later, they would have heard the same musical sounds
coming from her bed.</p>
<p>But when the day had fairly dawned, it would have
been difficult to find a more wide-awake, alert teacher
than the Fr&auml;ulein, or one that could have given a
truer and pleasanter Christmas day and night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>FR&Auml;ULEIN&#8217;S GYMNASTICS.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein, can you have prayers for the young
ladies in the small reception-room on Christmas
morning?&#8221; Miss Ashton asked with much hesitation
the day before leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ja! Ja!&#8221; answered the Fr&auml;ulein, all smiles and
nods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, I will give the notice to-night.
As Christmas is a religious festival, I shall be glad
to have a religious as well as a festival observation
of it. As for the matter of going to church, the
young-ladies can do as they please; there need be
nothing compulsory about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mistand,&#8221; and the Fr&auml;ulein congratulated herself
on her correct English. &#8220;All wrong; nein!
nein, all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Miss Ashton, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oui, Ja! Der Dank! Tanks. I learn Anglais
soon. Patientia, Fr&auml;ulein Ashton. I learn soon, by
un by.&#8221;</p>
<p>In compliance with this request, after a hasty
Christmas breakfast, the girls assembled in the
reception-room, and waited with more curiosity than
devotion the coming of the Fr&auml;ulein.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>She had not been down to breakfast, and when
she made her appearance now, it was as if an odd-shaped
swan was waddling into the room. From
head to foot she was dressed in a fluffy white stuff,
that stood out all over her like snow-feathers.</p>
<p>A stifled laugh greeted her, but of this she took
no notice; walking slowly to the table that had been
prepared for her, she turned a solemn face toward
the girls, opened a German prayer-book, and began
to read the service for Christmas morning, stopping
when she came to the places for the chant, and,
motioning to her audience to rise and join her, she
sang in sweet tones music familiar to the girls, in
which, with the English words they were accustomed
to, they all joined.</p>
<p>Then down she fell upon her knees, the others following
her example, and with her eyes half shut, and
her little hands folded reverently upon her prayer-book,
she rattled off prayer after prayer with astonishing
rapidity.</p>
<p>Now, though the young ladies had come in anything
but a solemn frame of mind, which the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s
droll appearance was not calculated to change,
there was something so devotional, almost solemn, in
her rapidly changing expression of face, that they
became at once and unconsciously devout. Dropping
on their knees, and covering their faces, they
joined her &#8220;Amens&#8221; with hushed voices, and into
their susceptible hearts the hallowing influence of
the religious festival found ready entrance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>They were hardly prepared to see the Fr&auml;ulein
spring lightly upon her feet, to hear a merry laugh
ring out, and &#8220;Good-morgen! good-morgen!&#8221; spoken
with the accompaniment of a cloud of white batting,
that flew off from her arms and shoulders as she
laughed.</p>
<p>Queer little Fr&auml;ulein! but good and kind as she
was queer!</p>
<p>All day long she worked indefatigably alone in the
big parlor. Not one of the girls was allowed even so
much as a peep within the doors.</p>
<p>The day was a rarely fine one for a New England
Christmas. The sun shone out of a cloudless sky; a
warm south wind blew gently over the deep snow-drifts;
little sparrows hopped delightedly upon the
branches of the Norway spruces that grew close to
the house, lifted their pretty wings as if to coax the
wind and sun, while they chirped their cheerful
Christmas carols, stole the late berries from the
trees, and twisted their round heads so they could
send loving glances up to the bevy of pretty girls
that watched and smiled down upon them, as they
fed them from their windows.</p>
<p>At seven o&#8217;clock the gong was sounded, and the
young ladies in gala dresses filed into the bright
parlor.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room was a large tree. Near
it stood the Fr&auml;ulein, smiling and courtesying to each
one as she entered. A quaint little figure she was;
yet, with all her quaintness, there was enough of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
dignity to suppress any merriment her appearance
might have caused.</p>
<p>The number and variety of these gifts was a marvel
to them. When they were fairly distributed, the
Fr&auml;ulein lifted the cover of an unopened box, and
took from it a gift for every teacher.</p>
<p>Good, happy Fr&auml;ulein! Not a thoughtful word or
a kind act from these to you strangers in a strange
land, but you have treasured in your homesick heart,
and from the Vater Land you bring to them all to-day
your grateful recognition of it all!</p>
<p>Perhaps the happiest of them was the lame Nellie,
who, yet weak and pale from her sickness, had with
the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s consent brought to the Christmas-tree
little pictures which she had painted in her convalescence,
as gifts to them all. She held tight to
Marion&#8217;s hand. In some way, she could not have told
you how, she seemed to herself to have owed to this
dear friend the ability to have painted them. It was
a little cross she gave Marion, but she had hung on
it a wreath of lovely rosebuds, meaning, through
them, to convey to Marion how her love had made
the cross of her suffering beautiful.</p>
<p>As the vacation had commenced on the twenty-third
of December, and school did not begin again
until the fifth of January, there was quite a time remaining
after the excitement of Christmas had passed.</p>
<p>The more scholarly and industrious of the girls
remaining at the academy at once applied themselves
to making up whatever deficiencies had occurred in
their studies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>Marion found plenty to do, not only for herself,
but also for Nellie, whose lessons had necessarily run
behind during her illness.</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein found them together over their books
much oftener than she thought was for their good.
Having been thoroughly educated in the German
methods of teaching, she was a firm believer in
vacation benefits, also in muscular training, which
she considered quite as essential for girls as for boys.
In her imperfect English, and also by personal illustration,
she had tried, ever since her connection with
this school, to awaken the teachers, Miss Ashton in
particular, to a greater sense of its importance. To
be sure, there was a gymnasium in the building, and
a regular teacher, who faithfully put her pupils
through the exercises commonly allowed to girls.
But these seemed to the Fr&auml;ulein to be only a beginning
of what might be done; so, now, finding herself
for a time in sole authority in the school, she at once,
as soon as Christmas was over, began to put her girls
through what she considered so essential to their
health.</p>
<p>She made her first attempt upon Marion and
Nellie. Finding them both bent nearly double over
their books, Nellie very pale, with dark rings under
her eyes, and Marion with flushed cheeks and too
bright eyes, she at once routed them from their
books, made them stand up before her, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, do&#8221;&mdash;and her English word failing her,
she drew a long breath from the bottom of her chest,
and motioned to them to imitate her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Marion, never having attempted anything of the
kind before, did so partially, and Nellie could only
produce something that sounded like a gurgle in her
small throat.</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein shook her head impatiently, and
repeated the process over and over again, Marion
gaining a little every time, but Nellie soon discouraged
and tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bard! bard! nicht right&mdash;aushauchen tief&mdash;so,
thus:&#8221; (deep breaths from the Fr&auml;ulein). Then,
seeming suddenly to remember that the girls did not
know why she made the request, she tried in an
anglicized German, which no one could by any possibility
have understood, to explain it to them. She
tapped her own head, took up a book, appeared to
read it, while she moved the leaves in time with her
long inhalations and exhalations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bon scholars! long&mdash;so!&#8221; Then suddenly she
said, &#8220;Patientia!&#8221; and vanished from the room. In
a few minutes the corridor was full of noisy girls,
who came direct to Marion&#8217;s room, and in obedience
to the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s directions arranged themselves in a
circle.</p>
<p>They had only the vaguest idea what they had
been called for, but they knew the Fr&auml;ulein always
gave them &#8220;a jolly good time,&#8221; and came willingly.
Merry enough they were for the next hour, and
much to the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s surprise, for they were
quicker than German girls, they made so much progress
that, after the second lesson, a plan that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
to tell much in future for the well-being of the
academy was fully developed.</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein drew up a paper in German, in which
she detailed not only the benefits physically resulting
from her system of deep breathing, but also the
help it would be in resting the excited nerves with
which so many of the young girls came into the
recitation-room. Then, before presenting it to Miss
Ashton, she roused the enthusiasm of her class by
telling them how much she needed their help, as
examples of the great good to be derived from her
gymnastics. And the result was that they had not
only the amusement of the exercises to help them
pass the vacation, but also the benefit resulting from
it, and the hope that through them it would become
a part of the school-life.</p>
<p>When Miss Ashton returned, she was not a little
surprised at the gain she so quickly recognized, nor
was she slow in availing herself of its aid.</p>
<p>She had always felt that nothing was more necessary
for a good working head than a perfect physical
balance, and for that reason she allowed and encouraged
a greater amount of amusement, which was
relaxation from study, than was common in what is
called a finishing school. It was almost the only
boast in which she indulged, that, during the twenty
years of her care of the academy as principal, she had
never had a case of fatal sickness, or, indeed, of any
severe enough to excite alarm.</p>
<p>During the fall she obliged the girls, as long as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
the weather would allow, to spend hours every day in
the open air, giving them their choice of exercise,&mdash;walking,
riding, boating, botanizing, geologizing, any
and every thing that would bring to them rest and
change. In winter there was dancing in the large
hall, there were compulsory gymnastics, there were
skating on the pond, coasting on the hills back of
the academy, or, not so seldom as it might have been
supposed would be the case among girls, snowballing
in the most approved boy-fashion.</p>
<p>Indeed, once upon a time it was reported that, having
come out, as she generally made a point of doing
whenever any amusement was going on, to witness
the sport, a girl more audacious than any of the others
ventured to throw a snow-ball in the direction of
her august person, and it was received with such a
merry laugh, that another followed, and another, and
another, until she was as ermine-covered as if she
were dressed for a court reception; and not a girl
among the laughing crowd but loved her better and
respected her more.</p>
<p>&#8220;My best recitations,&#8221; she was often heard to say,
&#8220;come after the best frolics. Give me pupils with
steady nerves, bright eyes, and sweet, clear voices,
and I will show you a school where they study well,
and the deportment is of the best.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am never so anxious about my girls as when
the weather shuts them in-doors, and the cold makes
them want to hug the radiators.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was on account of the good common-sense by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
which this method of regulation was carried on, that
the school was sought far and near; to this, in a
great measure, it owed its success.</p>
<p>The gymnastic teacher already employed was a
good one for the old methods; but there was something
so inspiring in the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s enthusiasm on
the theory of long breaths, that Miss Ashton made
it at once a part of daily practice, and put her in as
teacher for those classes.</p>
<p>Watching the result of the experiment, it took
Miss Ashton but a short time to satisfy herself as to
its immediate benefits; and as for the girls themselves,
they were so amused and strengthened by the
lessons that, after a little practice, it became a favorite
diversion, and you would find them often in
merry groups, inhaling and exhaling, perhaps not
in exact accordance with the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s rules, but
gaining at least in proportion to their enjoyment.
As for the Fr&auml;ulein, a very happy and proud teacher
she boastfully declared herself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>WOMEN&#8217;S WORK.</h3>
</div>
<p>The Christmas holidays being over, the young
ladies returned slowly, and many of them reluctantly,
to the school.</p>
<p>A few left for good; some of them on their own
account, some at the request of the principal. New
pupils took their places, and almost at once the
regular routine of work began.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton in one of her short morning talks
told them, while the past term had been in many
respects a satisfactory one, there had been several
occurrences which she should be sorry to see repeated.
It would not be necessary for her to enumerate them;
they were well known to the old pupils, and for the
new ones, she sincerely hoped there would be no
occasion for them ever to hear of them.</p>
<p>There were now some important things, upon
strict attendance to which she should insist during
the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>One was, a more honest observance of the study
hours; another, less gossip: perhaps she should be
better understood if she said a higher tone of social
intercourse. A thing never to be forgotten was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
that the school-life was a preparation for the longer
one beyond, and that, a preparation for the one that
never ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she said, dropping into that hushed
tone which every girl in the remotest seat from her
desk heard so easily, &#8220;I think our lives are but the
school in which we all have set lessons to learn, set
tasks to perform; and our wise Teacher, so patient, so
gentle, so loving with us, when the great examination
day comes, will hold us strictly accountable for every
slighted lesson, for every neglected duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only impress upon you to-day how vitally
important here and hereafter the faithful discharge
of even your smallest duties may be to you, I should
know that when our year together is over, and I
part from many of you for the last time, I should
meet you again as &#8216;crowns of my rejoicing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need hardly say, certainly not to the more intelligent,
who would naturally gather information of
this kind, how varied and important a woman&#8217;s work
in life has grown to be. You are all more or less
familiar with the fact that we have now entrance
into the best colleges, both here and abroad. You
know how we are educated for every profession, and
to what eminence many of us have climbed. You
understand fully, that there is not a position in the
literary, business, mechanical, or art world in which
to-day a woman may not be found working successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, too, that where prizes have been offered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
in academical institutions, no matter for what object,
it is by no means an uncommon thing for it to be
awarded to a girl. Last week a class of fourteen
women were graduated from the law department of
the University of the City of New York. It is said
to be the first law class exclusively of women that
has ever been graduated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two female medical graduates have been appointed
house surgeons at two English hospitals. A
society has been incorporated in New York entitled
the &#8216;Colonial Dames of America,&#8217; and to be located
in New York City.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its objects are set forth to be, to collect manuscripts,
traditions, relics, and mementoes of by-gone
days for preservation; to commemorate the history
and success of the American Revolution and consequent
birth of the republic of the United States; to
diffuse healthful and intelligent information with
regard to American history, and tending to create a
popular interest therein, and to inspire patriotism
and love of country; to promote social interest and
fellowship among its members, and to inculcate
among the young the obligations of patriotism and
reverence for the founders of American constitutional
liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of prominent ladies are included in the
list of officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this connection I will read you a short article I
found in my morning paper; and here, let me say,
there is not a girl in the school who should not in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
some way manage to spend a half-hour every day in
looking over a newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard intelligent gentlemen complain of
the ignorance of women about the ordinary public
life.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They will talk to you,&#8217; they say, &#8216;about housekeeping
and servants: they grow eloquent over their
children, and sometimes their husbands; but take
them out of the region of home, and they are dull
company.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The exceptions of those who are up in the literary,
political, scientific, and socialistic world is infinitely
small, and all&mdash;all because they will not take the
trouble to make themselves intelligent on the great
questions of the day, by reading newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>To go on, however, with what women are doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The New Women&#8217;s Propyl&aelig;um, in Indianapolis,
Indiana, is now completed, and was dedicated January
27.</p>
<p>&#8220;This building bears the distinction of being the
first one erected by women not associated as a club
or society. Primarily, its use is for purely business
purposes, and secondly, with an educational object in
view. Six or seven women, with Mrs. May Wright
Sewall at the head, have raised the money and carried
out the project. It seemed at first to the public
generally like a wild scheme, but the women who had
the matter in hand knew just what they wanted, and
made every effort to carry out their plans successfully.
The board of managers is made up of fifteen
women.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Sewall says, &#8216;The building of the Propyl&aelig;um
has been to all of us a valuable experience. We
have been obliged to meet business men, and to
familiarize ourselves with business methods, and
have thus acquired an education unusual to women.
The lot has a frontage of seventy-five feet, and a
depth of sixty-seven feet. The building contains
twenty-one rooms, there being two stories above an
English basement. The lot cost $5,500, and the
building complete $22,500, making a total of $28,000;
and $2,000 has been put into furniture. The front
of the Propyl&aelig;um is of ashlar and rock-face work,
and it is pronounced a very beautiful structure. The
women take special pride in the kitchen, which is
complete in every respect. In the front basement
are two sets of doctors&#8217; offices, both of which were
rented long ago; one set to Dr. Maria Gates, and the
other to Dr. Mary Smith. Dr. Gates is a graduate
of the Chicago Medical College, and Dr. Smith of
the Michigan University. The latter is physician at
the female prison and reformatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The east parlor is rented by the Woman&#8217;s Club,
the Matin&eacute;e Musicale, the Indianapolis Art Association,
and the Contemporary Club, each of which has
arranged to meet on such occasions that they will
not interfere with each other. The west parlor is
rented for physical culture classes, and to the
Christian scientists for their Sunday meetings.
The assembly hall will be for rent for entertainments.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is interesting, as showing what an active,
intelligent set of women have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some day I shall be receiving newspaper
notices of even more important and successful work
accomplished by some of my pupils. Here is an
interesting notice of women as inventors: &#8216;Within
the last century, women have entered for the first
time in the history of the world as competitors with
men in the field of original contrivances. In the
last two years and a half they have secured from the
government exclusive rights in five hundred machines
and other devices. In the line of machinery, pure
and simple, the patent-office reports show they have
exhibited great inventive capacity. Among remarkable
patents of theirs, are patents for electrical lighting,
noiseless elevated roads, apparatus for raising
sunken vessels, sewing-machine motors, screw propellers,
agricultural tools, spinning-machines, locomotive
wheels, burglar alarms.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Quite a sensation has been caused among the
clerks in the New York post-office by the entrance
of seven young women into the money-order department
as clerks during the last month. The girls
obtained their positions by surpassing their male
competitors at the civil-service examination, and will
receive the same pay as male clerks.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is another that will interest the ambitiously
literary among you:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Kingsley, daughter of Charles Kingsley,
has been awarded the decoration of the French
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
academic palms, with the grade of &#8220;officer of the
academy,&#8221; for her valuable writings upon French
art.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems, as you will notice from what I have
read you, no bounds to what we women not only can
do, but in which our success is generously allowed
and honorably mentioned; but there are several things
to which I may as well call your attention here.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not now, there never has been, an honorable
achievement, but it has been gained by steady,
persevering effort. I think I could pick out from
among the young ladies before me, those who in the
future will be able to hold positions of trust and
usefulness, perhaps renown; they are the girls who
are true, honest workers, day in and day out, week in
and week out. This honest work never has been,
never will be, done where time is frittered away,
where rules are broken, where those numberless
little deceits which I am grieved to say many a girl
who should be far above them sometimes practises;
it requires a noble character to do noble work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am desirous, particularly so, to impress upon you
all to-day, as it is the beginning of our longest,
hardest, and most important term of the year, the
necessity for every one of you individually doing her
best as a scholar, as a lady, and, let me add, what I
wish I could feel sure you would strive for beyond
all other claims, as a Christian. A true Christian is
as good a scholar as her natural abilities allow, a lady
she must be everywhere, and at every time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In closing, I have one request to make of you;
you will see, while it does not seem to bear immediately
upon what I have been saying, there is a close
connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to turn your attention specially to women&#8217;s
work in this nineteenth century. When you learn
in a more extended manner than I have been able to
give you this morning, what they have done, what
they are doing, and what they expect to do, you will
realize more fully your share in the life before you.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order that you may do this, at some not distant
time, we will all meet in the parlor, and I shall
expect every one of you to bring to me some account
of this work. From two hundred of you, we ought
to gather enough to make us not only proud of being
women, but ambitious to be among the leaders of
our sex.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>DECEIT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Ashton&#8217;s talk had an excellent influence
upon the school. Even the wealthy girls felt there
was something worth living for but society and
fashion. A large proportion of the pupils were from
families in moderate circumstances; to them avenues
of access to power and influence were opened. To
the poor, of whom there were not a few, help in its
best sense was offered in ways that faithful diligence
would make their own.</p>
<p>In just so far as Miss Ashton had made these two
things, faithfulness and diligence, the ground-work
of all success, she had given the true character to
her school; and as the work of the term began with
this demand upon the attention of the pupils, there
was a fair prospect of its being the best of the year.
The holidays had come and gone. Not a room in
the large building but bore evidence of its wealth in
Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>New books covered many of the girls&#8217; tables, new
pictures hung on their walls; chairs, old and faded,
blossomed into new life with their head-rests, their
pretty pillows and elaborate scarfs; ribbons of all
colors decked lounges, tables, curtains; pen-wipers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
lay gracefully by the side of elegant ink-stands, perfume
bottles stood on <i>&eacute;tag&egrave;res</i>, while the numbers
of hand-painted toilet articles, articles to be used in
spreads, bric-a-brac of all kinds and descriptions, it
would have been hard to number.</p>
<p>Pretty, tasteful surroundings are as much a part
of a girl&#8217;s true education as the severer curriculum
that is offered to her in her studies, and Miss Ashton
gave the influences of these Christmas gifts
their full value when she weighed the harder work
for the teachers which the vacation always brought.</p>
<p>To be sure, there came a time at the beginning of
the term when the unwise parents were responsible
for much bad work. Those of their children who
had come back with boxes filled with Christmas
luxuries&mdash;candies, pies, cakes, boxes of preserved
fruits, nuts, raisins, and whatever would tempt them
to eat out of time and place&mdash;had little chance to
do well in the recitation-room until these were disposed
of.</p>
<p>In truth, even more difficult, more of a hindrance
in her school discipline, Miss Ashton often found the
parents than their children.</p>
<p>She was sometimes obliged to say, &#8220;I could have
done something with that girl if her mother had
let her alone.&#8221; One fact had established itself in
her experience, that almost every girl committed to
her care had, in the home estimation of her character,
traits which demanded in their treatment different
discipline from that given to any of the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>She could have employed a secretary with profit,
simply to answer letters relating to these prodigies,
and nine out of ten proved to be only girls
of the most common stamp, both for intellect and
character.</p>
<p>Marion had spent her vacation time in a profitable
manner. As mathematics was her most difficult
study, so she had given her attention almost entirely
to it; and even Miss Palmer, who was never good-natured
when a pupil was advanced into one of her
classes, and by so doing made her extra work, was
obliged to confess she was now among her best
scholars.</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Marion received an impetus in
all her other studies; and, of course, as good scholarship
always will, this added to the influence which
her sterling moral worth and kindly ways had already
given her.</p>
<p>There was one dunce in her mathematical class
who gave her great annoyance; it was Carrie Smyth,
a Southern girl, into whose dull head no figures ever
penetrated.</p>
<p>There was something really pitiable as she sat,
book in hand, trying to puzzle out the simplest problem,
and Marion often helped her, until Miss Palmer
prohibited it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not allow it,&#8221; she said decidedly. &#8220;If
Carrie cannot get her own lessons we ought to know
it, and to treat her accordingly. Whatever assistance
she needs, I prefer to give her myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Marion obeyed, and Carrie cried, but the consequences
followed at once.</p>
<p>Carrie soon learned to copy from Marion&#8217;s slate
whatever she needed, and, as Marion sat next her in
the class, this was an easy thing to do; and as Miss
Palmer, wisely, seldom asked Carrie any but the
simplest questions, well knowing how useless any
others would be, she escaped detection until, one
day, grown bolder by her escapes, she copied from
Marion more openly, Marion seeing her. That this
might have happened once, but never would again,
Marion felt quite sure; but what was her dismay,
when she saw it continue day after day. She was
ashamed to let Carrie know of her discovery, as
many another noble girl has been under similar circumstances,
but she knew well that it could not be
allowed, and that to pretend ignorance of the fact was
wrong.</p>
<p>She moved her seat, but, after staring at her
blankly out of her dull eyes, Carrie moved hers to
her side, and the class all laughed at this demonstration
of affection; but Miss Palmer, who had
taught long enough to know that it might mean something
but affection, watched them. She had not
long to do so before she discovered Carrie&#8217;s trick,
Marion&#8217;s knowledge of it, and her embarrassment.</p>
<p>After recitation, she told them to remain, and
when they were alone together she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion Parke! how long have you known that
Carrie Smyth copied her sums off your slate?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>Poor Marion! She looked at Miss Palmer, then at
Carrie; the color came into her face, and the tears
into her eyes, but she did not answer a word.</p>
<p>Miss Palmer repeated her question with much
asperity. Still no answer, but two large tears on
Marion&#8217;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not choose to answer me&#8221; (a little more
gently now): &#8220;I shall report your behavior to Miss
Ashton. Carrie Smyth, how long have you been
copying Marion&#8217;s sums, instead of doing your own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve never copied them, Miss Palmer,&#8221;
said Carrie, looking Miss Palmer boldly in the
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carrie Smyth, I saw you do so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I never did, never, Miss Palmer. <i>Never!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to your room, Carrie Smyth. I am not surprised
at your readiness to tell a falsehood; you have
been acting one for weeks, and they are all the same,
the acted and the spoken, in God&#8217;s sight. Go to your
room and pray; ask God to forgive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she opened a Bible which lay on a table near
her, and in very solemn tones read these words,
&#8220;&#8216;But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable,
and murderers&#8217;&#8221; (glancing off now in a threatening
manner at Carrie), &#8220;&#8216;and whoremongers, and
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their
part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone,
which is the second death.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrie turned very pale. If Miss Palmer had asked
her for the truth again, she would have told it, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
she did not; she only motioned the girls from the
room, and went herself to see Miss Ashton.</p>
<p>Incidents similar to this were not unusual in the
school, and Miss Ashton always considered them the
most painful and troublesome to deal with. She
waited a day or two before taking any notice of it,
then she sent for Marion, who went to her room with
fear and trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion,&#8221; said Miss Ashton, beckoning to her to
come and sit on the sofa beside her, &#8220;I am very
sorry on your account that this has happened. It
would have been better if you had told Miss Palmer
as soon as you knew what Carrie was doing; better
for her, for of course she was deceiving, and we
know what that means; better for Miss Palmer, for
she could form no just estimate of Carrie&#8217;s scholarship,
for which she is responsible; and better for you,
because, in a certain way, it made you a partaker in
the deception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Miss Ashton! I could not tell on her; I
could not, <i>I could not!</i>&#8221; exclaimed Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you perfectly,&#8221; said wise Miss
Ashton; &#8220;I only want you to see the situation as it
is. If you had thought of it, you might have come
to me. Everything of that kind I should know, then
your responsibility would have ceased, and, without
making a class matter of it, I could have influenced
Carrie to do right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you fully understand me, run back to
your lessons, only remember, in whatever perplexity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
for the future you find yourself, I am the house
mother, and you are all my children; you would not
have hesitated to tell your mother if you had found
any of your brothers or sisters doing wrong, should
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am; I should have gone to her at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And not felt that you were a tell-tale?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so, then, it is here; we are all one family,
and there is nothing mean in reporting to me, more
than to a mother. It&#8217;s the motive that prompts the
telling that gives it its moral character. It is the
noblest that can act wisely, and escape the odium
of tell-tales; and, my dear Marion, I feel quite sure
that for the future I can trust you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion went away with a light heart. &#8220;Trust me?
of course she can,&#8221; she said to herself; &#8220;but I am
so sorry for Carrie Smyth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrie, in truth, even after listening to the terrible
denunciations Miss Palmer had read to her, was to
be pitied for her moral as well as mental dulness.
She went through the ordeal of her talk with Miss
Ashton with far less feeling than Marion had shown;
and the only punishment she minded was being put
back into the class of beginners, and being told that
the next time she was found doing anything of the
kind, and told a falsehood about it, she would be
expelled from school.</p>
<p>This, on the whole, she would have liked, for study
was detestable to her, and there was nothing but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
ambition of her mother that made it seem necessary
in her home surroundings.</p>
<p>Both Miss Palmer and Marion were delighted to
have her leave the class. Marion kindly kept the
reason for her having done so to herself, though
many inquiries were made of her by the other
scholars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>MARION&#8217;S LETTER FROM HOME.</h3>
</div>
<p>Soon after the first of January, Marion received
the following letter from her mother:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;We have all been made so happy to-day, my dear child, by a letter
from Miss Ashton. She writes us how well you have been doing,
and how much attached to you she has become. All this we expected
as a matter of course, but what delights and satisfies us most, is
what she says of your religious influence in the school. We knew
we were sending you into an untried life, that would be full of anxieties
and temptations. With all the confidence we felt in you, we
should hardly, no matter how great the literary advantages offered,
have liked to put you where the character of your surroundings
would have been less helpful; and to know that you, in your turn,
are proving helpful to others, is indeed a great gratification. God
bless, strengthen, and keep you, my darling, through this new year,
is your loving mother&#8217;s prayer.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;It almost seems to me that we miss you more and more as time
goes. Phil counts the weeks now until you come home, and I found
the little ones busy doing a long sum on their slates, which, when
they brought to me to see if it was right, I saw was to ascertain first,
how many days before you came, and then, how many hours. Bennie
told me that to-morrow they were to calculate the minutes, and then
the seconds. I suppose they have, for I see them studying the
clock very often, particularly the minute hand.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;So you see how we miss and long for you at home.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Your father is busier than ever. He is truly a workman of whom
his Master need not to be ashamed. He keeps well and happy. Deacon
Simonds came in last night to ask him to have some extra meetings,
as the Methodists were going to have an evangelist here, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
might draw away people from his church; but your father said in his
gentle way, &#8216;The parish was not too large as yet for him to do all the
work required, and if any of his people could be benefited by the
evangelist, and should wish to unite with that church, he should
wish them Godspeed.&#8217; Then the deacon said something about the
difficulty of raising the salary, which I minded more than your father.
What a good, trusting man he is! Mrs. Hoppen ran in this noon
with a large tin pan full of delicious doughnuts she had fried for us,
and Hetty Sprague put two pumpkin-pies into my pantry window.
Not a day passes but we are cared for in some way. I laugh, for it
looks as if they thought now you are gone there was no one left to
prepare goodies for the home. Tim Knowles dumped a load of coal
into our cellar when your father was away, then came to the kitchen
door and said,&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;&#8216;Mis&#8217; Parke, you tell the parson if he&#8217;ll keep up the fire of religion
in the church, I&#8217;ll keep it up in his study stove, and it sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
cost him a copper cent. We all d&#8217;ought to have ways of sarving the
Lord, and this &#8216;ere is mine.&#8217; Then he hurried away, without giving
me a chance to even say &#8216;Thank you.&#8217;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Sometimes it seems to me as if our whole parish felt as if you
belonged to them, and they had sent you away to school, and were to
pay your expenses, they are so wonderfully kind and thoughtful of
us. Your sabbath-school class sent you their New Year&#8217;s gift yesterday;
I know you will value it. Old Aunt Cutts is knitting you a pair
of blue stockings; the dear old lady is taking so much comfort out
of the work, that she has made them large enough for you to put both
of your little feet into one; and Kate Sanders brought me her white
feather to ask me if, now you had to dress stylish, I didn&#8217;t think you
could make use of it. I thanked her, and told her that you were
wearing a hat so small I was sure the feather was too large for it. I
think it was quite a relief to her, for that soiled and bedraggled
feather is to her still, &#8216;the apple of her eye.&#8217;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;So, my dear parish child, you have a great burden of responsibility
to carry; but your mother knows how easily and how honorably it
will be borne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion read this letter with a variety of feelings.
It had never been the home way to make her religious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
character a separate and distinct thing. It
dominated the whole home-life. Do right, <i>do right</i>!
She had almost never been told, do not do wrong, but
always do right, and this meant simply and only, be
a Christian. It was such a noble way to step upward
from the beginning; not easy, oh, no, far from that,
so often doing wrong in spite of precept and example,
so often hesitating, until the delay weakened the
power of doing right; yet so often, with hope and
prayer to aid her, planting her foot firmly on the
upper rung, singing as she went.</p>
<p>Since she had been in school her life had been so
changed, such different temptations to do wrong,
such different helps to do right, that she had thought
little of her influence upon her companions. The
letter of her mother was almost a shock, as, for the
first time, it brought up to her what she felt had
been her neglect.</p>
<p>All these months here, and what had she ever
done or said that would tell for Jesus? Three
room-mates; had she ever tried, from the first of her
coming among them, to help them into a Christian
life? To be sure they had their set times for private
devotions, time required by the rules, when every
pupil was expected to read her Bible, if nothing more.
That they had all done, and Dorothy had &#8220;entered
into her closet, and shut her door.&#8221; There could be
no doubt that she had prayed to her Father which
is in secret, and her Father which seeth in secret
had rewarded her openly; for, often, when she came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
back among them, her face had been so full of sweet
peacefulness. &#8220;Dorothy&#8217;s influence has been the
one for good, not mine,&#8221; Marion thought, with that
true humility which is a Christian grace. As for
Gladys, why she was Gladys, and there was no one
like her. So generous and noble, so true and faithful;
I must learn of her surely, not she of me; but
Susan! It must be confessed, that in the busy days
Marion had almost forgotten Susan&#8217;s dishonesty.
She did not like her, often she found it hard to be
even patient, much less kind, to her, and Susan was
sometimes very trying. She could, and did, say many
unkind words, &#8220;spites me,&#8221; Marion said to herself;
but generally bore the ill-humor pityingly, feeling
sorry for a girl who could do as Susan had done.
The fact was, that while Marion did not have Susan&#8217;s
guilt often in her mind, Susan never forgot it when
she saw Marion. <i>Never</i> may be too strong a word
to use; but Susan was constantly uneasy in Marion&#8217;s
company, often positively unhappy, wishing over and
over again she had never heard of &#8220;Storied West
Rock,&#8221; especially never, never been tempted to steal
that story, and palm it off for her own.</p>
<p>Not a day of her life but she expected to be found
out, to be disgraced before the school, perhaps to be
expelled. Poor Susan! she is reaping now the result
of her selfish lifetime ambition to be among the noted
ones, to be thought of first, and treated like a heroine!
Ambition is a very laudable thing; we should all try
to do our best, but never should it lead us into doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
selfish, mean, dishonorable things; then it becomes
a sin and not a virtue.</p>
<p>It was the weakness, nay, something worse, in
Susan&#8217;s character, as we all know, always leading her
into trouble, because it was so wholly selfish.</p>
<p>If Marion could have reasoned all this out as we
can, she would have had fewer compunctions of
conscience as she sat holding her mother&#8217;s letter in
her hand, thinking over its contents.</p>
<p>It was some time before she could fully enjoy all
the items of family news it contained. Then they
drew her pleasantly back to the dear home, the small
parish, and the life-long friends she had left there.</p>
<p>Gladys had been watching her as she read the
letter, amused and interested by the different phases
of feeling her face showed; when she saw her fold it
up, she asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened, Marion? You&#8217;ve looked as if
you had been at a funeral, and then at a wedding,
while you were reading it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have&mdash;almost,&#8221; and Marion could laugh now.
&#8220;Let me read you the last part of it; it is so like
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Marion read them about the children&#8217;s sum,
and the parishioners&#8217; kindness; and Gladys, as she
listened, planned how she could help Marion without
her ever suspecting from whence the help came,
and Dorothy thought what a different home it must
be from that she had left at Rock Cove.</p>
<p>Marion, instead of studying her next lesson, as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
was obviously her duty to do, sat with her book open
before her, wondering how she could immediately
enter upon a course of conduct that would give
her a more enlarged and prominent religious influence.
Never once suspecting that this was a way
the tempter was taking to lead her from the true self-abnegation
which is so vital to a growing Christian
character. Single-eyed to God&#8217;s glory!</p>
<p>Miss Ashton in the recitation looked at her inquiringly
several times. What could have happened,
she wondered, to make Marion blunder so? She
was generally prompt, and, considering how much
she had to do to keep up with her class, correct; but
to-day she seemed distraught, as if her mind were
anywhere but upon her recitation. She stopped her
after the lesson was finished, and asked her if she
were sick; but Marion was well, nor was she, in her
preoccupation, aware that Miss Ashton was not
pleased.</p>
<p>She answered her carelessly, which increased the
teacher&#8217;s uneasiness, and made her ask a little
sharply, &#8220;What is it, Marion? You did badly in
your recitation to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am!&#8221; said Marion, looking at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you made a bad recitation,&#8221; repeated Miss
Ashton. &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the color grew deeper and deeper in Marion&#8217;s
face. &#8220;My letter from my mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;O
Miss Ashton, I am so sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for what? Is any one sick?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Ashton; but&mdash;but&mdash;there was so much
to think of in it. I am so sorry I did badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Miss Ashton smiled. &#8220;If that is all,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I will try to forgive you. Can&#8217;t you tell me
something about your home letter? I like to hear
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Marion poured out her whole heart, thanking
her kind teacher simply and winningly for her
own kind letter to the Western home, but giving no
hint of the seed of evil the letter may have sown.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXII_PENITENT' id='CHAPTER_XXXII_PENITENT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>PENITENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion&#8217;s first plan in order to extend her religious
influence was to get up a small prayer-meeting in
her room.</p>
<p>To be sure, the room was shared by three others,
and she had never quite gotten over the uncomfortable
feeling that she was an intruder, particularly as
Susan so often showed hostility to her; but a prayer-meeting
surely was a thing no right-minded girl
ought to object to. Of Dorothy&#8217;s approval she had
no doubt. Gladys, if she did not wish to stay, would
go away without the least hesitation. Susan! What
Susan would do, who could tell? Knowing the need
she had of a vital change in character, in order to
be a Christian, Marion made no attempt to conceal
from herself that her conversion alone was an object
worth earnest and constant prayer; really the reward
for the conquering of any diffidence she might have
to overcome in instituting the meeting. It was not
an hour after she had decided upon the twelve girls
she would invite, before the tempter had her in his
power again. She was planning the order of exercises
for the meeting, which was as it should be; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
it was not as right that she was leaping forward in
her thoughts to the criticisms which the girls would
make upon the part she should take, the hope that
they would admire her fluency and spirituality, and
say to her when they were leaving the room,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Marion! how much good you have done us!
We shall be grateful to you as long as we live.&#8221;</p>
<p>If any one had told her that here, by this same
desire for self-aggrandizement, or, to call it by its
more common name of popularity, Susan had fallen,
she would have been astonished indeed.</p>
<p>Prayer-meetings were by no means uncommon in
this academy; but they were under the care of a
teacher, and it was not long before the necessity of
asking leave for the one in her room occurred to
Marion; but here was a difficulty! Would not Miss
Ashton ask her questions about this, which she
would find difficult to answer; such as, &#8220;What made
her propose it? What did she expect to accomplish?&#8221;
If she did ask these, what could she say?</p>
<p>There followed another day of poor recitations,
and Marion, for almost the first time since she joined
the school, was undeniably cross. By night she was
sitting on the penitential stool, ashamed, tired, and
full of wonder as to what had happened to her. As
is not unusual in such cases, she was inclined to blame
every one but herself. Miss Palmer had lost her
patience with her because she hesitated over a difficult
place in her mathematical lesson, and had
snapped her up before the class; Anna Dawson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
had laughed at her blunder, and the whole class had
most unkindly smiled. Dorothy had put her arm
around her and asked her if she was sick, when she
knew there was nothing the matter with her. Even
Gladys had stopped scratching with her slate-pencil,
looking at her in a way that said as plainly as words
could, &#8220;What a nervous thing you are, not to bear
the scratching of a pencil without wincing;&#8221; and as
for Susan, tormenting as she had been on other days,
she had been angelic in comparison with this.
After all, she had too much good common-sense and
true religious feeling to sit upon her stool long
without beneficial results. It was nearly time for
the lights to be put out before she began to see the
first thing to be done was the right one; that is always
sure. Do the duty nearest to you, then those more
distant fall readily into line and are easily met.
This was, to see Miss Ashton, no matter how awkward
it would be to tell her that the thought of the prayer-meeting
was first put into her head by Miss Ashton&#8217;s
letter home; that before, her religious influence had
not been a thing of which she had for a moment
thought, but that now she wished to make it
tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
give it up because I&#8217;m a coward. I shall not sleep
a wink unless it&#8217;s settled. Life is short; death may
come at any unexpected moment. I should not like
to have my Judge ask why I had not done my duty,
when, perchance, I, even I, might have been a poor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
weak instrument, but still an instrument, in saving a
soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this spirit Marion went to Miss Ashton&#8217;s room,
quite forgetting the lateness of the hour, and knocked
timidly at the door.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton, wearied by her day&#8217;s anxieties, did
not approve of these late calls, and only answered
them for fear of sickness, so it was some time before
she said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not surprised to see Marion, for Miss
Palmer had already reported her failure in the mathematical
class; but she said kindly,</p>
<p>&#8220;What is wrong now, Marion? Have you had
another letter from home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Ashton; it is&mdash;it was&mdash;I mean, I wanted
to ask you if you had any objection to my having a
prayer-meeting in my room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A prayer-meeting in your room?&#8221; repeated Miss
Ashton. &#8220;Why do you ask it?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the question Marion had expected; but
now, with Miss Ashton looking straight in her eyes,
she hesitated to answer it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;I hoped,&#8221; she blundered at last, &#8220;that
I might do more good,&mdash;might, perhaps, save Susan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; and Miss Ashton looked very grave now.
&#8220;Your mother has told you what I wrote her of your
religious influence here, and you wish to increase it;
but why Susan particularly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Marion found herself unexpectedly in deep
waters. If she attempted to answer this question,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
what disclosures she would have to make! A tell-tale!
A mischief-maker! A character of all others
she despised, and so did, she well knew, the whole
school. She hung her head, the color coming into
her face, and the tears into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something wrong here,&#8221; Miss Ashton
thought, but she only said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Dorothy is a good girl; I am very fond
of Gladys; but why do you select Susan as the one
in the whole school to be prayed for, or with?&#8221;</p>
<p>If an equivocation had been natural or easy to
Marion, she might have been ready with several now,
which perhaps would have satisfied Miss Ashton;
but she was a straightforward, honest girl, who never
in her whole life had been placed before where she
hesitated what to answer; if she had been a culprit
to-night, she would hardly have looked more utterly
discomfited than standing there trying to look Miss
Ashton in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not choose to answer me,&#8221; Miss Ashton
said after waiting a moment. &#8220;Very well, then, we
will go back to the prayer-meetings; I think it would
be unwise for you to attempt any such thing. You
might at first find a few girls who would be willing
to come, but they would soon tire of it, and you would
find yourself alone, unless Dorothy&#8217;s kind heart made
her willing to remain. Let me tell you, my dear
Marion, the best, in fact the only way for a pupil to
exert a strong and lasting religious influence is by
living a consistent Christian life. What you <i>are</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
always tells, never what you may appear. If you
are truly desirous to exert this influence, you will let
your companions see it in your daily walk and conversation.
All the prayer-meetings you could have
would be useless, if you yourself failed in a Christian
grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be kind, loving, gentle, true, faithful in all your
duties, great and small, that is what your parents and
I hope for in you. I had almost said, and I am sure
you will not misunderstand me, I would rather have
the influence of good recitations, strict observance of
rules, lady-like behavior in all places and at all times,
than a prayer-meeting in your room every night in
the week. Now it is late; go back, and if you do not
wish to tell me what is wrong with Susan, I must be
all the more observant of her myself. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion said &#8220;Good-night&#8221; faintly; certainly this
was a very different reception from what she had expected.
&#8220;She wants me to be perfect,&#8221; she said to
herself fretfully, &#8220;and she knows that I never can be;
then Susan! What have I done? Oh, dear! dear!
I wish I had never thought about a prayer-meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far she had only dimly seen where her motives
had been wrong, but she felt their check.</p>
<p>Fr&auml;ulein Sausmann met her on her way to her
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Marione!&#8221; she said, drawing her little self
erect, and trying to look very dignified, &#8220;I am astonish!
I am regret! You am very onright. You
am to be gone to Fr&auml;ulein Ashton next day and say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
you regret; I determine on it! Marione, you stand-under?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just come from Miss Ashton,&#8221; said Marion
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You has just come! Very bad. You <i>schlecht
Fr&auml;ulein</i>! What you for done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, Fr&auml;ulein. At least,&#8221; correcting herself
as she remembered Susan, &#8220;I hope nothing <i>schlecht</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not say right, Marione; I shame you
German speak so <i>schlecht</i>.&#8221; Then the Fr&auml;ulein
laughed merrily, and standing on the tips of her little
toes she kissed Marion on both cheeks.</p>
<p>The kisses went right to Marion&#8217;s heart, cheered
and comforted her so her face had a less troubled
look as she entered her room.</p>
<p>Susan was sitting at the table studying, and the
searching glance she gave her made the color rush
into Marion&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone and told of me, the ugly, mean, old
thing,&#8221; thought Susan. &#8220;I knew she would sooner
or later. Now I&#8217;m in for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>In vain she tried to fasten her attention on her
book again. Over and over the consequences of the
disclosure she went with beating heart. &#8220;Oh, if I
had never, never, never done it!&#8221; she said to herself
in the helpless, hopeless way that attends a wrong
action. The short-lived celebrity the story had given
her had all died away, nothing remained but this
dreadful regret, and fear of what was to come.</p>
<p>When she saw Marion go into her bedroom, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
had almost a mind to follow her and confess the
truth. Then she thought Marion knew it already,
had perhaps told Miss Ashton, and a better thing to
do would be to go to Miss Ashton and make the confession;
to go at once, this very night, before she had
a chance to tell the whole school: perhaps if she did,
Miss Ashton would be merciful, would scold and forgive
her. She looked at the clock; if she made
haste there would be five minutes before they must
put their lights out! Once done, what a relief it
would be!</p>
<p>She darted from the room, not daring to trust a
moment&#8217;s delay; but when she reached the corridor
the lights were already turned out. All would soon
be darkness, and then none were allowed to leave
their rooms.</p>
<p>But Susan was desperate now; she knew her way
down the long flights of stairs so well that she had
no fear: her only thought was to reach Miss Ashton,
to confess, to know her punishment, if punishment
there were to be.</p>
<p>She flitted softly, like a ghost, through the long
corridors, down the long stairs; but when she came to
Miss Ashton&#8217;s door her gas was turned out, and that
meant she would not open her door again that night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll knock! Perhaps, just perhaps, she will let
me in;&#8221; but there was no response to Susan&#8217;s knock.
She stood waiting until she shivered with nervous
dread from head to foot, then she crept back to her
room, and tossed restlessly through a weary night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>SPRING VACATION.</h3>
</div>
<p>The bright light of a sunny day has a wonderful
influence in quieting fears, and the next morning
when Susan waked and found her room cheerful,
everything looking natural and pleasant, her first
feeling was one of shame for all she had suffered the
night before. Nothing was easier now than to make
herself believe she had been foolish in her suspicion
of Marion; indeed, it was not long before she had
made herself almost sure that Marion knew nothing
about the stolen story, that she had wronged her in
suspecting, even if she did, that she would be mean
enough to betray her. For the first time since she
copied it, she treated Marion not only kindly but
affectionately, much to Marion&#8217;s surprise, for she
knew how near she had come to betraying Susan,
and remembered Miss Ashton&#8217;s saying, &#8220;If you do
not choose to tell me what is the matter with Susan,
I must be all the more observant of her myself.&#8221;
Would she watch her? Could she ever in any way
find out about &#8220;Storied West Rock&#8221;? &#8220;At any rate,&#8221;
Marion comforted herself by thinking, &#8220;it will not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
through me; but I wish I had not said even what
I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wondered over Susan&#8217;s advances, and met
them coldly, shamefacedly. &#8220;If you only knew,&#8221; she
said to herself, &#8220;how different you would act!&#8221;</p>
<p>Very important as these events seem to those
particularly engaged, they make little apparent difference
in the life of a large school.</p>
<p>Marion again made faulty recitations, and again
her teachers were troubled by them; but Susan, having
in a measure, she could hardly understand how,
been thrown off her fears, was unusually brilliant in
her classes, winning what she valued so much, words
of approbation from her teachers.</p>
<p>The school work went on now with much success.
The holiday break-up was fairly over. Washington&#8217;s
Birthday was not celebrated other than with an abundance
of little hatchets of all designs and colors.
Easter was too far away, and the <i>animus</i> of the
school was for quiet study. Even the club held
meetings less often. The two girls who had been
the chief planners of whatever mischief originated
from it, Mamie Smythe and Annie Ormond, were
on their best behavior, knowing full well that another
misdeed, no matter of what character, meant
expulsion.</p>
<p>Upon these weeks preceding the Easter vacation,
Miss Ashton had learned to rely for the best part of
the year&#8217;s work; so uneventfully, with the exception
of now and then some slight escapade on the part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
of the pupils, the term rolled on to its spring
rest.</p>
<p>Easter came in the early part of April this year,
but the season was backward, even snowstorms
coming now and then; and fierce winds, more like
March than April, forbade any hunting for early
flowers, or looking, as so many longing eyes did, for
the swelling of the bare branches of the trees, or the
first shadowing of the green tassels that waited to
show themselves to warm sunbeams.</p>
<p>There were no examinations in this school, or
marking the grade of scholarship; but for all that,
there was never a doubt who were the best scholars,
or who would have taken the prizes if any had been
given.</p>
<p>A week before Easter, Marion received a letter
from her Aunt Betty, inviting her to spend the coming
recess with her; but she declined it, asking that
the visit might be deferred until the long summer
vacation, when, as she was probably not to return
home, she should be very glad to come. Evidently
Aunt Betty had forgotten whatever was unpleasant
in the Thanksgiving visit, and to be among the
mountains through some of the hot summer weeks
seemed to Marion would be pleasant indeed. But
when the vacation came, and she found herself with
only a few other girls almost alone in the great
desolated building, she more than once regretted her
decision.</p>
<p>A pleasant young teacher of gymnastics, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Orne, was left in charge, but she was tired, and more
anxious to rest than to amuse the girls, so they were
left pretty much to themselves, and passed the ten
days of vacation in the best way they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls will be girls,&#8221; that was what Miss Ashton
said when the pupils who had been at home came
back with their summer outfits, and she found the
whole attention of the school given for a few days
to their examination and comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could hear you talk half as much about any
branch of study, or your art lessons, as I hear you talk
about your new clothes,&#8221; she said with a pleasant
laugh, &#8220;I should be delighted; but I suppose nothing
seems more important to you now than the fashions,
and, on the whole, I don&#8217;t know but I am glad of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was this interest in their many-sided life that
gave Miss Ashton her great influence over them.
The girls would take articles of apparel to her for
her inspection, and find them doubly valuable if they
met with her approval.</p>
<p>There was one set whose wardrobes were objects
of especial interest: those were the graduating class.
Next to her bridal dress, there seems to be no other
that is thought so much of, not only by the girl, but
by her parents.</p>
<p>It would be idle, perhaps out of place here, to
say how much display and foolish extravagance there
is at such a time. Where it can be well afforded,
it is of comparatively little importance, but a great
deal of heartache might be avoided, if the simplest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
costume were decided to be the most suitable.
Parents whose means have been tried to the utmost
to give their child the advantages of the school, who
have never hesitated over any labor or self-denial in
order to accomplish it, find themselves at last called
to confront the question of dollars, hardly earned or
saved, squandered on a dress almost worthless for
future use, on pain of seeing their child mortified
and unhappy because she cannot, on this eventful occasion,
look as well as the others. Even Miss Ashton&#8217;s
influence, great as it was, had failed to accomplish
any good result in changing this long-established
custom; and for reasons best known to themselves,
the present senior class had voted in their class
meetings to make their graduation day one long to
be remembered in the annals of the school.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIV_NEMESIS' id='CHAPTER_XXXIV_NEMESIS'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>NEMESIS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Until this year this academy had had a salutatory
and a valedictory in the same way they did at Atherton
Academy, given for the best scholarship as it
was there; but as this was considered a finishing
school, differing therefore from the boys&#8217; school,
which was only preparatory for other and higher
education, it had been decided to change the graduating
exercises to the four best essays, read by their
writers, an address by some distinguished orator,
music, and the giving of diplomas.</p>
<p>All the graduating class were expected to write an
essay, the Faculty to judge of their merits, and to
choose from among them four of the best.</p>
<p>Not only the interest of the class, but of the whole
school, was intense on the writing of these essays.
The literary merit of the teaching was to be shown
by them; and as no graduating class ever comes to
its commencement without pride in, and love for its
<i>alma mater</i>, so it seemed as if the future reputation
of the academy must depend upon the way this class
acquitted itself.</p>
<p>If it had been a boys&#8217; school, bets would have run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
high on the supposed best writers; here there was
nothing of the kind, only those who had done well
whenever compositions had been read to the school
were chosen as girls of especial interest, watched,
<i>f&ecirc;ted</i>, praised, encouraged, in short, prematurely made
heroines of.</p>
<p>Among the most conspicuous was Susan Downer.
Though so little had been said of late of her success
in writing &#8220;Storied West Rock,&#8221; it was now recalled;
and, as the weeks flew by before commencement,
she was daily, sometimes it seemed to her hourly,
reminded of it, and importuned to be sure and do as
well now.</p>
<p>Poor Susan! She knew how really unable she
would be to do anything that would compare with it.
Over and over again she made the attempt; but as
writing was not one of her natural gifts, and as now,
whenever she tried even to choose a subject, the theft
came up before her, and she went through the whole,
from the first temptation to the last crowned success,
she could think of nothing else but the inevitable
punishment that somewhere and at some time was
waiting for her.</p>
<p>There was but one hope she thought left for her,
to see her brother Jerry, and tease him into giving
her one of his essays, that she might use it as it was
if possible, if not, with alterations that would make
it suit the occasion. She would tell him that she
only wanted to read it and get some hints from it,
and once in her possession, she could do as she
pleased.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>When she received his note refusing her invitation
to come to the academy, her disappointment and her
helplessness may be readily imagined, for she had
allowed herself to depend upon him.</p>
<p>To write to him for an essay she knew would be
useless; he would only laugh, and say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! what does Sue want one for?&#8221; but if
he were with her, he was so kind and good-natured,
he would do almost anything she asked.</p>
<p>But one thing now remained. Miss Randall, their
teacher in rhetoric, who had the charge of the essays,
gave subjects to those who wished them; she could
apply to her, and perhaps find in the library something
to help her.</p>
<p>Miss Randall gave her, remembering her former
success, and hoping she would do even better now,
an historical subject, &#8220;The Signal of Paul Revere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There have not been more than a hundred poems
written on the same subject,&#8221; she said in a little talk
she had with Susan; &#8220;but if you can write poetry,
and succeed, all the better for Montrose Academy.
We will send it to the newspaper, and it may be the
beginning of making your name famous.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a temptation to a girl like Susan!</p>
<p>If&mdash;only <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>IF</span> she could find one of those hundred or
more poems, find perhaps the whole of them, and
make rhymes (easy work that), and be &#8220;famous,&#8221;
what a glorious thing it would be!</p>
<p>Here was, alas, no repentance, or even fears of
doing wrong. It almost seemed as if the new temptation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
had obliterated memory of the old theft, and
she was about to enter upon what she had always
longed for, a career of fame.</p>
<p>She began to haunt the library, particularly the
shelves of American poetry; but there was nothing
to be found that had special reference to Paul Revere,
not one of &#8220;the hundred and more pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this way she wasted a great deal of precious
time, until, disappointed and discouraged, she was
about asking for another subject, when she came
upon a volume of collections of poetry written on
the late war, and a sudden thought that this might
be made to answer the same purpose unfortunately
struck her. She had read this kind of poetry but
little; but had enough literary taste to make her
choose one of the very best, consequently most popular
and well known, for her model. &#8220;Model,&#8221; she
said to herself when, delighted, she found how easily
she could use it with alterations.</p>
<p>No miser was ever made more happy by a bag of
gold than she by this discovery. &#8220;Famous! famous!
An honor to Montrose Academy!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, when her poem was ready for Miss
Randall&#8217;s examination, she read it aloud to her room-mates,
and their astonishment and delight over her
success they were too generous to withhold.</p>
<p>Dorothy had worked very hard on her essay. It
was carefully and well done; but Gladys&#8217;s, short, brilliant,
straight to the point, without pause or repetition,
was an effort of which an older, more accustomed
writer need not have been ashamed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>But neither of these, they decided, could hold any
comparison with Susan&#8217;s. It was Marion who, though
she did not recognize the poem, could not forget
&#8220;Storied West Rock,&#8221; that listened with a troubled
face, and only added a few faint words to those of
the others&#8217; praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is an ugly, jealous old thing!&#8221; Susan made
herself think, as she watched her narrowly; but then
would come the thought, &#8220;I wonder if she suspects
me?&#8221; remembering the story, and a cloud fell instantly
over the bright sky of her hopes. But she
was not to escape so easily; when she carried her
poem to Miss Randall, she only glanced at the heading
and down over the neatly written page, without
reading a line, then said, &#8220;Come to me to-morrow
afternoon at three, and we will read and correct it
together. I hope you have made a success of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan almost counted the hours until three came;
then, proud and happy, she presented herself at Miss
Randall&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>The teacher had the poem on a table before her,
and by its side a book, the covers of which Susan
recognized at once as being the volume from which
she had stolen the poem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Susan,&#8221; said Miss Randall gravely.</p>
<p>Then without another word she began to read first
a line of Susan&#8217;s poem, then one from the poem in
the book, pausing over the changed words, to substitute
the one for the other.</p>
<p>In truth, the changes were very few, how few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Susan had not realized until they were thus set
before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is hardly what might be called a parody,&#8221;
Miss Randall said as she ended, looking gravely into
Susan&#8217;s face. &#8220;I suppose you had no idea of passing
it off as your own work?&#8221;</p>
<p>How inevitably one wrong act leads to another!
There is an old saying that &#8220;one lie takes a hundred
to cover it,&#8221; and it is true.</p>
<p>Susan had confidently expected this to pass for her
own; but now, without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, looking
Miss Randall fully in the face, with a pleasant smile
she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Miss Randall! I knew you would recognize
it; you are too good a teacher of literature not
to suppose you would be familiar with such a fine
poem as that. I thought if I made a successful
parody, it would be better than any poor thing I
could write myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Randall was for a moment staggered. Was
the girl telling her the truth, or was it only a readily
gotten-up excuse? She waited a moment before she
answered, then she said coldly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;This will not pass at all. I am sorry you have
wasted so much time upon it; you will begin at once
upon your essay, and, for fear you will be tempted
to use some thoughts not your own, I will change
the subject. You will write an essay on &#8216;Truth.&#8217;
Good-afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ashton!&#8221; said Miss Randall, presenting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
herself, a few moments after Susan&#8217;s departure, in
the principal&#8217;s room. &#8220;I am afraid Susan Downer
never wrote that excellent story, &#8216;Storied West Rock.&#8217;
I always have wondered over it, for it was far superior
to anything else she has done since she has been
in school, and now, I am sure, though she denies it
in a very plausible way, that she has copied a poem,
with only a few immaterial changes to make it fit her
subject, intending to palm it off for her own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ashton did not answer at once; she was busy
thinking. With the other teachers, her surprise had
been great at the ability Susan had shown in the
story; and now, instantly, she connected this report
of Miss Randall&#8217;s with Marion&#8217;s embarrassed mention
of Susan&#8217;s name, and her own intention to discover
what was wrong. Perhaps Susan had stolen
it, and Marion had become acquainted with the theft.
It was not impossible, at any rate she must inquire
into it, so she said to Miss Randall.</p>
<p>A day or two was allowed to pass before any
further notice was taken of it, then Miss Ashton had
decided to spare Marion, and call Susan directly to
her. Susan had word sent to her that she was wanted
in the principal&#8217;s room, and obeyed the summons
with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Susan!&#8221; said Miss Ashton, &#8220;I am willing to believe
that you copied your poem with the innocent
intention of passing it off as a parody, and that you
really did not know it could not be accepted, but
there is one other thing that troubles me. Some
time ago you wrote an excellent story called &#8216;Storied
West Rock;&#8217; was that yours, or another parody?&#8221;</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 365px;'>
Susan dropped her head upon her chest, the color surging into her face, and the tears dropping from her eyes; but she did not speak a word.&mdash;Page 343. <i>Miss Ashton&#8217;s New Pupil.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>Susan! Susan! Tell the truth now; tell it at once,
simply, honestly. Do not conceal even how you have
suffered from it, not even how unkind and cross you
have been to Marion. Own it all at once, quickly,
without giving the tempter even a chance to tempt
you! Don&#8217;t you know, don&#8217;t you see, how much
your future depends upon it?</p>
<p>Susan dropped her head upon her chest, the color
surging into her face, and the tears dropping from
her eyes; but she did not speak a word.</p>
<p>In the silence of the room you could have heard
a pin drop.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton was answered. When she spoke
there was tenderness and deep feeling in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me the truth, Susan?&#8221; she said.
But Susan did not answer; she only burst into a fit
of hysterical sobbing, and after waiting a few moments
in vain for it to subside, Miss Ashton added,
&#8220;You had better go to your room now. I hope you
will come soon to me, and tell me the whole truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan rose slowly, lifting her swollen and discolored
face up to Miss Ashton with an entreating look the
kind principal found it hard to resist; but she did.
She held the door open for Susan to pass out, and
watched her go down the corridor with a troubled
heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>FAREWELL WORDS.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was little difficulty when the time came in
deciding the four essays to be chosen. Kate Underwood&#8217;s
was in most respects the best, and would
take the place usually filled by the valedictory.
Dorothy Ottley&#8217;s was the next strongest, and by far
the most thoughtful. To no one&#8217;s surprise as
much as to her own, Gladys Philbrick&#8217;s was the most
brilliant, and Edna Grant&#8217;s, the best scholar in
English literature, the most scholarly.</p>
<p>So the important question was settled a week
before commencement, and the young ladies were
given their choice, either to read their pieces or to
speak them.</p>
<p>Greatly to the surprise of the teachers they all
chose to speak them, and the elocution teacher was
at once put to drilling them for the occasion.</p>
<p>The choice was pleasantly accepted by the school.
Every one of the four were favorites, and whatever
disappointment the rejected essayists felt, they kept
wisely to themselves.</p>
<p>Susan Downer&#8217;s essay on &#8220;Truth&#8221; was a miserable
failure, and a disgraced future was the only one
she could see opening before her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>She could not summon courage to make a confession
to Miss Ashton; she decided, after hours and
hours of troubled and vexatious thought, to be silent,
trusting to her speedy removal from the school to
silence all further questionings.</p>
<p>Such a busy week as this was now at the academy!
The mail brought every day piles of letters to teachers
and scholars, which must be answered. Invitations
were to be sent. All the preliminaries of a
great gathering were to be attended to, and both the
excitement and the listlessness attendant on a closing
year were to be met and combated.</p>
<p>It would be interesting if we could tell the story
of each individual during this eventful period, but it
would fill a whole volume by itself, so we must be
contented by telling simply of those with whom we
have had the most to do.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton tried as far as she could, with so
much else to attend to, to have a little personal conversation
with every pupil who had been under her
care for the year. Sometimes she saw them alone,
sometimes she took them in classes, according to the
importance of what she had to say. Before talking
with Marion she sent the following short letter to
her mother:&mdash;</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Mrs. Parke</span>,&mdash;I should esteem it a personal favor if
you would allow your daughter Marion to remain with me free from
expense to you for another year. She has proved in all regards not
only an excellent scholar, but, as I wrote you before, the influence of
her lovely Christian character has been of great value to me. I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
be glad to do all I can to help her into the influential and well-balanced
future I see before her. You need have no fear that a feeling
of indebtedness to me will be a burden to her, delicate as her feelings
are. I propose, by putting her at the head of my post-office department,
to fully repay myself for all she will receive. This will not
interfere with her studies or her needed recreation, but will come at
hours she can easily spare.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>Hoping this will meet with your cordial approbation,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 4.6875em;'>Truly yours,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>A. S. Ashton.</span></span><br /></p>
<p>It was not until an answer to this had been
received that Miss Ashton sent for Marion to come
and see her. Marion had in the mean time a letter
from her mother, asking if she wished to remain. To
which Marion had answered, &#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221; So now
all Miss Ashton had to do was to tell Marion how
satisfied she was both with her and the arrangement,
and Marion to tell her kind teacher of her delight in
remaining.</p>
<p>Gladys was to return with her father after a pleasant
summer spent at Rock Cove, and to her, Miss
Ashton had much wise advice to give regarding her
future. A motherless child, an indulgent, though
wise father, no brothers or sisters, only a crowd of
worshipping dependents; probably not to another
girl in the whole school was there to come years
which would test the character as hers was to be
tested.</p>
<p>Excellent advice was given; the question was,
Would it be followed?</p>
<p>For Dorothy there was less doubt. Miss Ashton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
had already found a school for her, where, excellently
well-fitted, she could begin in the fall her career as a
teacher. Of her success, only Dorothy felt a doubt.</p>
<p>Susan Downer, Miss Ashton had put off seeing
until the last, hoping the girl would come herself and
confess, if there was anything to confess; but as day
after day went by, Susan shunning her when she
could, and when she could not, passing her with
averted face, Miss Ashton saw she must take the
matter into her own hands and settle it one way or
other; to ignore was to condone it. It was, therefore,
only a few days before the close of the term
when Susan, who had grown almost buoyant in her
hope of escape, found herself summoned to what she
was sure was to be her final trial.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t expel me now,&#8221; she said to herself
triumphantly as she went to the room, &#8220;and she
can&#8217;t withhold my diploma, for that is for scholarship,
and I stand well there, so I&#8217;m safe at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still it was a trembling, pale girl that answered
Miss Ashton&#8217;s &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want you to leave me uncertain both of
your truth and honesty,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;I have
been waiting, hoping you would come to me of yourself,
but as you have not, I <i>demand</i> now an answer
to my question. Did, or did you not write &#8216;Storied
West Rock&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I d&mdash;i&mdash;d.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she had time to finish the answer, Miss
Ashton had said emphatically, &#8220;<i>not</i>; I know the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
truth, Susan! I want to spare you the falsehood I
see you are about to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to ask you where you found the
story; I only want you to see, and see so plainly that
you can never forget it, how small and mean a thing
such a deceit, or any deceit, is, and how sure in the
end to turn to the injury of the one who commits it.
Of all the class that are to leave me, you, Susan
Downer, carry away with you my greatest anxiety
for your future. God help and save you, you poor
child!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Ashton&#8217;s voice had tears in it as she ceased
speaking, and those, more than any words she had
spoken, reached and moved the girl before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Miss Ashton! Miss Ashton!&#8221; Susan cried,
rushing to her, and throwing both arms around her
neck. &#8220;Do, <i>do</i>, <i>do</i>, please forgive me? It was
Marion Parke&#8217;s book, and I thought no one would
ever know. I&#8217;ve been so sorry. I&#8217;d have given
worlds, worlds, <i>worlds</i>, if I had never seen it! O
Miss Ashton, what shall I, shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask God to forgive you,&#8221; Miss Ashton said
solemnly. &#8220;It is another and a greater judge than I
that has the power to do so. If I were only sure,&#8221;
but she did not finish her sentence, she only loosened
Susan&#8217;s arms gently from around her neck, then said
&#8220;good-by&#8221; to her, and watched her once more as
she went away down the corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Marion Parke knew it all the time, but
would not tell on Susan,&#8221; she said to herself as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
turned back into her room. &#8220;Marion is a girl to be
depended upon, I am glad she is to stay with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kate Underwood,&#8221; she said, when Kate&#8217;s time
came for the farewell counsel, taking both of the girl&#8217;s
hands in hers, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you. You have done
of late what many older and wiser persons have failed
to do,&mdash;learned the lesson, which I hope has been
learned for your lifetime, that there is no fun
in things, however written or spoken, that hurt
other&#8217;s feelings. I have seen you many times
thoughtful and tender, when your face was alive
with the ridiculous thing you saw or heard. Kate,
I feel so much safer to let you go from me now than
I should have six, even three months ago. Tell me,
will you try not to forget?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good as long as I live. I&#8217;ll never make
fun, no, not even of myself,&#8221; burst out Kate, &#8220;though
now I&#8217;m dying to get before a mirror and see how I
must have looked when you thought me so thoughtful.
Was it so, Miss Ashton?&#8221; and Kate made up a
face which a sterner rebuker than her teacher could
not have seen without a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use, Kate,&#8221; she said; &#8220;go now, only
don&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Kate made a sweeping courtesy and disappeared.</p>
<p>With Mamie Smythe she had a long talk, not one
word of which did either divulge. In that hour it
would be safe to say Mamie learned some life-lessons
which it will be hard for her to forget.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>And so the time passed on. Recitations ceased
four days before commencement, and the girls, those
even who thought themselves over busy before, found
every hour brought a fresh claim upon their time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bee-hive,&#8221; Miss Ashton called it, and the
girls called her the &#8220;queen bee,&#8221; and made many
secret plans about the various gifts they were to
give her the last night of the term. The ceremony
this year was to be a public one, therefore of great
importance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>WOMEN&#8217;S WORK.</h3>
</div>
<p>The night before commencement Miss Ashton had
reserved for the reading of notices of woman&#8217;s work
and success. This she did at that time, because
she wished her pupils to carry away a full belief not
only in their own abilities, but also in the position
which, with diligence, these abilities would enable
them to reach.</p>
<p>The whole school gathered in the hall. Miss
Ashton had requested that the notices should be
handed in to her a few days previous. Now
she said, &#8220;Young ladies, I am both surprised and
pleased at the readiness and faithfulness with which
you have responded to my request. I have here,&#8221;
lifting a pretty, ribbon-tied basket, &#8220;at least one
hundred different notices! Just think! <i>one hundred</i>
instances in which women have tried, and have succeeded
in earning not only a respectable, but a successful
livelihood. This fact speaks so well for
itself, that all remaining for me to do is to read you
some of these notices. I must make a selection
from among them, and the first one I will read I am
sure will interest you:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mlle. Sarmisa Bileesco, the first woman admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
to the bar in France, is said to have taken the highest
rank in a class of five hundred men at the &Eacute;cole
du Droit, Paris, where she studied after receiving the
degree of Bachelor of Letters and Science in Bucharest.
She has begun to practise law in the latter
city, where her father is a banker.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is another one in the same profession:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mrs. Tel Sone is a leading lawyer in Japan, and
has a large and profitable practice.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Jean Gordon of Cincinnati, upon whom
will be conferred the degree of Ph.G. at the Philadelphia
College of Pharmacy, has earned the highest
average ever attained by any woman graduate of that
institution. Out of one hundred and eighty-four
graduates of this year, only six obtained the highest
rating of &#8220;distinguished.&#8221; Miss Gordon was one of
the six. She was the only woman in her class, and
had to contend with bright young men.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Gordon, I think,&#8221; remarked Miss Ashton,
&#8220;has a distinguished future before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Female professors and lecturers are to be introduced
into the Michigan University at Ann Arbor.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Two female medical graduates have been appointed
house surgeons at two English hospitals.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An Ohio girl discovered a way of transforming
a barrel of petroleum into ten thousand cubic feet of
gas.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Another woman has constructed a machine which
will make as many paper bags in a day as thirty men
can put together.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An invention which you hardly would have expected
from a woman, is a war vessel that is susceptible
of being converted off-hand into a fort by simply
taking it apart.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Chicago, March 25. Miss Sophia G. Hayden
of Boston wins the one thousand-dollar prize offered
for the best design for the woman&#8217;s buildings of the
World&#8217;s Fair.&#8217;&#8221; (A sensation among the scholars,
which pleased Miss Ashton). &#8220;&#8216;Miss Lois L. Howe,
also of Boston, was second, five hundred dollars, and
Miss Laura Hayes of Chicago gets the two hundred
and fifty dollars offered for the third best design.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Hayden is a first-honor graduate of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Miss
Howe is from the same institution. Miss Hayes is
Mrs. Potter Palmer&#8217;s private secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;As soon as the awards were made, Miss Hayden
was wired to come to Chicago immediately and elaborate
her plans. The design is one of marked simplicity.
It is in the Italian renaissance style, with
colonnades, broken by centre and end pavilions.
The structure is to be 200 &times; 400 feet, and 50 feet to
the cornice. There is no dome. The chief feature
of ornamentation is the entrance.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to tell those of you young ladies who
feel symptoms of architectural genius only waiting
for development, that year by year this institute is
opening its door wider and wider to admit women.
This last year the ten who are new members of it
were for the first time invited to a class supper, going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
to it matronized by Mrs. Walker, the wife of the
president.</p>
<p>&#8220;One other thing I want you to remark. These
three young ladies, by their ability, and the success
which is the fruit only of faithful study, have done
more for women&#8217;s advancement than has been accomplished
for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man who is a successful architect occupies an
important and proud position; that a woman can do
the same is no small help in the struggle she is now
making.</p>
<p>&#8220;I recommend them to you as examples, particularly
as I know there are a number among you who
will not be content to let graduation from this school
end your educational life.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next I shall read you is a notice of women
as journalists:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me give you a fact about women as journalists
in my own office,&#8217; said the editor of one of the
largest dailies to me a few days ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Five years ago I employed one woman on my
staff, to-day I have over twenty, and the best work
which appears in our papers is from the pen of
women writers. Of course you cannot give
women all sorts of commissions; but if I want a
really conscientious piece of work done nowadays,
I give it to one of our women. I find absolutely
they do their work more thoroughly than do the
men.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Young ladies, it has always been complained of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
women that, though they are quicker, guided by
instincts that act promptly and for the greater part
correctly, they are not patient or thorough. Now,
as I have told you so often that it must sound trite
to you to have me repeat it, it is only patient
thoroughness that wins. I am glad to have this
editor of one of our largest dailies give this indubitable
testimony that we <i>can</i> be thorough if we
will. For those of you who neither wish nor expect
to continue study any further, I will read the opportunity
offered for a bucolic life:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Miss Antoinette Knaggs, a young woman with
a good collegiate education, owns and manages a
farm of two hundred acres in Ohio. She says she
made money last year, and expects to make more this
year. &#8220;I have tried various ways of farming,&#8221; she
says, &#8220;but I find I can get along best when I
manage my farm myself. I tried employing a manager,
but I found he managed chiefly for himself.
Then I sub-let to tenants, and they used up my
stock and implements, and the returns were unsatisfactory.
So I have taken the management into
my own hands, planting such crops as I think best,
and I find I am a very good farmer, if I do say it
myself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Said the daughter of a New Hampshire farmer
to me a few days ago,&#8221; continued Miss Ashton,
&#8220;&#8216;When my father died my mother took the control
of our whole large farm into her own hands. She
managed so well that we have sold our farm and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
moved down to suburban Boston, where we can command
the literary advantages she has taught us not
only to prize but to love.&#8217; The collegiate education
fitted Miss Knaggs to be a better, wiser farmer. I
hope if it shall be the choice of any of you, you will
find yourself abler for your life here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure we shall,&#8221; thought a Dakota young
lady, whose father&#8217;s broad ranch covered many a
goodly acre, and whose secret wish had always been
to own a ranch of her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to be no profession now from which
a woman is shut out, though we hear of fewer among
lawyers than in any other profession. I find only
one more among all these notices. &#8216;Fourteen women
were graduated from the university of New York
Law School last night, among the number being
Mrs. George B. McClellan, daughter-in-law of the
late General McClellan.&#8217; But I well know there
have been women associated with their husbands in
the law. Women also with their own offices, doing
a large and important business.</p>
<p>&#8220;In England, civil service is open to them; and
though it does not correspond of course with our
law, still the same strict education is needed for
success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a paper which states the terms on which
ladies enter the civil service.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They enter as second-class clerks, receiving $325
a year, rising by fifteen dollars a year to $400. Here
the maximum, which is certainly small, is reached;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
but there is promotion by merit to clerkships, rising
to $550 a year, and a few higher places, which
go up to $850. Three lady superintendents each
receive up to $2,000, and four assistant superintendents
each $1,000. The work is not difficult, and the
hours are seven a day. An annual holiday of a
month is allowed.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;These wages are no larger than would be paid
here for the same services. I know women have no
difficulty, if once elected, in filling clerkships and
secretaryships, and they even have important places
in the treasury department at Washington. A very
telling record might be, probably has been, made of
their successes there.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the medical profession we all know how rapidly
they have risen to the front. Stories that sound
almost fabulous are told of the income some of the
most talented receive; and to show the popularity
this new movement has attained, it is only necessary
to state that at the present day it would be hard to
find a town, north, south, east, or west, which has
not its woman doctor. The medical colleges have
large classes of them; and in Europe names of many
American girls, if they do not lead in number, do at
least in ability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here there was a resolute stamping and clapping,
which pleased Miss Ashton too much for her to
attempt to stop it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had more time I could tell you some wonderful
but entirely true stories of difficult surgical operations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
being performed in foreign hospitals by young
American women in so remarkable a way that they
excited not only the applause of the fellow-students,
but won prizes.</p>
<p>&#8220;As this is only one of the professions, I must
hurry on to the ministry. We all know that in some
of our denominations there are numbers of women
who occupy the place of settled minister, and do
well. On the whole, however, they may be considered
more successful as lecturers, Bible-readers, and
elocution teachers; and then there is a wide open
field to them as actresses and singers; indeed, no
public or private way of earning a livelihood or a
reputation is denied them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching always has been theirs, and year after
year the profession becomes more and more crowded
and the requirements for good teachers more strict.
Many of you, young ladies, I find are looking forward
to this in your immediate future. I need not
here urge upon you the necessity of being well prepared
when your day for examination comes. I have
held it up before you during all the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incomplete list of the great things
which I expect you young ladies of the graduating
class to perform. I would not, however, on any
account, forget that broad and specially adapted
woman&#8217;s work,&mdash;the different philanthropic schemes
with which this nineteenth century abounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many are in women&#8217;s hands; like women&#8217;s
boards of missions, children&#8217;s hospitals, homes for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
little wanderers, young women&#8217;s Christian homes,
young women&#8217;s industrial union, North End missions,
Bible-readers, evangelists, flower committees
for supplying the sick in charity hospitals, providing
excursions for poor children, providing homes in
the country for the destitute and orphan children,
society of little wanderers, newspaper boys&#8217; home,
boot-black boys&#8217; home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible for me to name but a small part
of them, but those of you who have the means of
helping any one of these objects named, or any of
the many others, will remember, I hope, that wonderful
cup of cold water which, given, shall give to
the giver the rich reward.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will probably be my last opportunity to
speak to you alone as my school. Let me thank you
heartily for all you have done this year, and some of
you for four long years, to make our life together
pleasant, and we hope acceptable to our great Taskmaster.
I wish you now, for myself and all the other
teachers, a pleasant vacation, and a safe return to
those of you who are to come back to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were many quiet tears shed among the girls,
and Miss Ashton&#8217;s eyes were not quite dry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h3>COMMENCEMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Commencement morning rose upon Montrose
clear, bright, and hot. Almost with the first dawn
of the early day the hum of busy preparation began.
Every hour of the previous day and night had
brought parents and friends, some from great distances,
to attend the celebration.</p>
<p>The quiet town swarmed with strangers, all with
faces turned toward the large brick building which,
standing boldly prominent on its hill, had a welcoming
look, as if the roses around it, that filled the air
with their delicious fragrance, had blossomed that
morning in new and charming beauty.</p>
<p>The lawn, plentifully besprinkled with small flower-beds,
was elsewhere one broad sheet of velvet green;
and the blossoms of every variety and every hue
crowded the beds so cheerfully, so merrily, that
many parents lingered as they passed them, their
hearts warming at the sight of the Eden in which
their daughters had lived.</p>
<p>Commencement exercises were to be held in the
large hall, to which ushers appointed for that purpose
took all the visitors before the entrance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
school, so it really made quite an imposing show
when Miss Ashton, arm in arm with the president
of the Board of Trustees, came slowly in, the gentlemen
composing the board following, then the teachers,
and after them the pupils in their gay holiday
dresses. The senior class, of course the most
prominent, coming onto the stage with the other
dignitaries.</p>
<p>There was nothing of peculiar interest in the
exercises that followed. Commencements all over
the country are much the same. The four young
ladies who were to read their essays acquitted themselves
well. Gladys, to her father&#8217;s great delight,
with her soft Southern voice, her sparkling face, and
her easy, self-possessed, graceful ways, was the undoubted
favorite. A storm of applause followed the
reading, and bouquets of flowers fell around her in
great profusion.</p>
<p>It was the bestowing of the diplomas that attracted
the most attention.</p>
<p>There was something touching in the gentle smile
of the aged president as, calling each member of
the class by her name, he spoke a few Latin words
and handed her the parchment that made her for life
an alumna of Montrose Academy. It was almost as
if he had laid his hand on her head in benediction.</p>
<p>The pleasant dinner that followed was the next
marked event of the day. To this all the school,
and as many invited guests as could be accommodated,
sat down, and the large hall was full of the cheerful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
voices of those who had come to congratulate and
those who were congratulated. Nothing could have
made a more fitting ending to the home-life of the
busy year; so many kindly, cheering words spoken,
so much of hearty encouragement for the coming
year.</p>
<p>Pupils and teachers, some of them together for
the last time, but hardly among them an exception
to the tender affection which bound them together.</p>
<p>Susan Downer had been graduated. She held her
diploma in her hand as she went off the stage with
the others, but she was far from happy. &#8220;Miss
Ashton is glad to have me go,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;She
neither respects nor loves me.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one noticed her dejection. Amidst the general
happiness she seemed to herself forgotten, almost
shunned. &#8220;And I had hoped,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;to
make this such a triumphal day!&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be idle to waste any sympathy on Susan.
There is an old adage, &#8220;As you make your bed, so
must you lie in it.&#8221; She had done a dishonorable,
untrue thing, and had repented only over its consequences.</p>
<p>It is very sad but true, that what we have once
done, or left undone, said, or not said, can never be
recalled. No repentance can efface its memory; no
tears can blot it out; and only one, the great, kind
Father, can forgive.</p>
<p>Susan to the last day of her life will have that act
clinging to her. She can never forget it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>The moral is obvious, needing no words to make
it plainer.</p>
<p>Immediately after dinner the school broke up and
the departures began.</p>
<p>The farewells that were spoken, the tears that
were shed, the oft-repeated kisses that were given,
it would be difficult to tell.</p>
<p>By twilight the large building began to have a
desolated look. Miss Ashton, pale and tired, stood
bravely in a doorway, kissed and wiped away tears,
and silently blessed pupil after pupil in rapid succession.</p>
<p>The Rock Cove party considerately made their farewells
brief, and taking Marion with them hurried to
the evening train that was to carry them home.
Then down over the building settled the beautiful
June twilight, and the year of study was over.</p>
